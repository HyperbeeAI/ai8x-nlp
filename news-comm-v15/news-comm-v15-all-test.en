China’s pursuit of an IVC and a 1-IFC city would serve not only its own interests.
Allowing the renminbi to help meet global demand for international reserves and risk diversification would also strengthen global financial stability.
There is little time to waste in internationalizing the renminbi.
Given the limited number of currencies that can serve as IVCs, the failure of the renminbi to achieve IVC status before, say, the Indian rupee, the Russian ruble, or the Brazilian real could mean that the renminbi is denied IVC status – and that Shanghai fails to achieve 1-IFC status – for generations, if not forever.

Winners and Losers in the Post-9/11 Era
September 11, 2001, is one of those dates that mark a transformation in world politics.
Just as the fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989, signified the Cold War’s end, al-Qaeda’s attack on the United States opened a new epoch.
A non-governmental group killed more Americans that day than the government of Japan did with its surprise attack on another transformative date, December 7, 1941. While the jihadi terrorist movement had been growing for a decade, 9/11 was the turning point.
Five years into this new era, how should we characterize it?
Some believe that 9/11 ushered in a “clash of civilizations” between Islam vs. the West.
Indeed, that is probably what Osama bin Laden had in mind.
Terrorism is a form of theater.
Extremists kill innocent people in order to dramatize their message in a way that shocks and horrifies their intended audience.
They also rely on what Clark McCauley and others have called “jujitsu politics,” in which a smaller fighter uses the strength of the larger opponent to defeat him.
In that sense, bin Laden hoped that the US would be lured into a bloody war in Afghanistan, similar to the Soviet intervention two decades earlier, which had created such a fertile recruiting ground for jihadists.
But the Americans used a modest amount of force to remove the Taliban government, avoided disproportionate civilian casualties, and were able to create an indigenous political framework.
While far from perfect, the first round in the fight went to the US. Al-Qaeda lost the sanctuaries from which it planned its attacks; many of its leaders were killed or captured; and its central communications were severely disrupted.
Then the Bush administration succumbed to hubris and made the colossal mistake of invading Iraq without broad international support.
Iraq provided the symbols, civilian casualties, and recruiting ground that the jihadi extremists had sought in Afghanistan.
Iraq was George Bush’s gift to Osama bin Laden.
Al-Qaeda lost its central organizational capacity, but it became a symbol and focal point around which like-minded imitators could rally.
With the help of the Internet, its symbols and training materials became easily available around the world.
Whether al-Qaeda had a direct role in the Madrid and London bombings, or the recent plot to blow up airliners over the Atlantic, is less important than the way it has been transformed into a powerful “brand.”
The second round went to the extremists.
The outcome of future rounds in the struggle against jihadi terrorism will depend on our ability to avoid the trap of “jujitsu politics.” That will require more use of the soft power of attraction rather than relying so heavily on hard military power, as the Bush administration has done.
For the struggle is not a clash of Islam vs. the West, but a civil war within Islam between a minority of terrorists and a larger mainstream of non-violent believers.
Jihadi extremism cannot be defeated unless the mainstream wins.
Military force, intelligence, and international police cooperation needs to be used against hardcore terrorists affiliated with or inspired by al-Qaeda, but soft power is essential to attracting the mainstream and drying up support for the extremists.
US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld once said that the measure of success in this war is whether the number of terrorists we are killing and deterring is larger than the number that the terrorists are recruiting.
By this standard, we are doing badly.
In November 2003, the official number of terrorist insurgents in Iraq was given as 5,000.
This year, it was reported to be 20,000.
As Brig. General Robert Caslen, the Pentagon’s deputy director for the war on terrorism, put it, “We are not killing them faster than they are being created.”
We are also failing in the application of soft power.
According to Caslen, “We in the Pentagon are behind our adversaries in the use of communication – either to recruit or train.”
The manner in which we use military power also affects Rumsfeld’s ratio.
In the aftermath of 9/11, there was a good deal of sympathy and understanding around the world for America’s military response against the Taliban.
The US invasion of Iraq, a country that was not connected to the 9/11 attacks, squandered that good will, and the attractiveness of the US in Muslim countries like Indonesia plummeted from 75% approval in 2000 to half that level today.
Indeed, occupying a divided nation is messy, and it is bound to produce episodes like Abu Ghraib and Haditha, which undercut America’s attractiveness not just in Iraq, but around the world.
The ability to combine hard and soft power is smart power.
When the Soviet Union invaded Hungary and Czechoslovakia during the Cold War, it undercut the soft power that it had enjoyed in Europe in the aftermath of World War II.
When Israel launched a lengthy bombing campaign in Lebanon last month, it created so many civilian casualties that the early criticisms of Hezbollah by Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia became untenable in Arab politics.
When terrorist excesses killed innocent Muslim civilians such as Egyptian Islamic Jihad did in 1993 or Abu Musab al-Zarqawi did in Amman in 2005, they undercut their own soft power and lost support.
The most important lesson five years after 9/11 is that failure to combine hard and soft power effectively in the struggle against jihadi terrorism will lead us into the trap set by those who want a clash of civilizations.
Muslims, including Islamists, have a diversity of views, so we need to be wary of strategies that help our enemies by uniting disparate forces behind one banner.
We have a just cause and many potential allies, but our failure to combine hard and soft power into a smart strategy could be fatal.

The Middle East’s Lost Decade
BERLIN – The United States has waged three wars since Al Qaeda’s terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001: against Al Qaeda, in Afghanistan, and in Iraq.
The first two were forced upon the US, but the third was the result of a willful, deliberate decision by former President George W. Bush, taken on ideological grounds and, most likely, for personal reasons as well.
Had Bush, former Vice President Dick Cheney, former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and their neocon allies been forthright about their intentions – to bring down Saddam Hussein by means of war, thereby creating a new, pro-Western Middle East – they never would have received the support of Congress and the American public.
Their vision was both naive and reckless.
So a threat – Iraqi weapons of mass destruction – had to be created.
As we now know, the threat was based on lies (aluminum tubes for a nuclear-weapons program, for example, meetings between the 9/11 plot leader, Mohamed Atta, and Iraqi officials in Prague, and even glaring forgeries like supposed Iraqi orders for yellowcake uranium from Niger).
Such were the justifications for a war that was to claim the lives of almost 5,000 US soldiers and more than 100,000 Iraqis.
Add to that the millions more who were injured and displaced from their homes, as well as the destruction of one of the world’s oldest Christian communities.
For this, the US alone spent up to $3 trillion.
Bush’s war against Saddam did radically change the Middle East, though not as he envisaged.
For starters, if the US had set out to destabilize Iraq, its efforts could hardly have been more successful: ten years later, the country’s viability as a single state has never been in greater doubt.
With Saddam gone, Iraq’s Shia majority assumed power after a horrendous civil war, leaving Iraq’s defeated Sunnis longing for revenge and waiting for an opportunity to regain their ascendancy.
The Kurds in the north cleverly and adeptly used the window of opportunity that opened before them to seize de facto independence, though the key question of control over the northern city of Kirkuk remains a ticking time bomb.
And all are fighting for as large a share of Iraq’s enormous oil and gas reserves as they can get.
Taking stock of “Operation Iraqi Freedom” a decade later, the Financial Times concluded that the US won the war, Iran won the peace, and Turkey won the contracts.
I can only agree.
In political terms, Iran is the big winner of Bush’s war.
Its number-one enemy, Saddam, was dispatched by its number-two enemy, the United States, which presented Iran with a golden opportunity to extend its influence beyond its western border for the first time since 1746.
Bush’s war, with its poor strategic vision and worse planning, increased Iran’s regional standing in a way that the country was unlikely ever to have achieved on its own.
The war enabled Iran to assert itself as the dominant power in the Gulf and the wider region, and its nuclear program serves precisely these ambitions.
The losers in the region are also clear: Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf states, which feel existentially threatened, and have come to regard their own Shia minorities as an Iranian fifth column.
They have a point: with the Shia in power in Iraq, Iran will seek suitable opportunities to use local Shia populations as proxies to assert its hegemonic claims.
This is what is fueling Bahrain’s domestic turmoil, beyond the Shia majority’s local grievances.
Leaving aside the lies, fictions, and questions of morality and personal responsibility, the critical mistake of America’s war against Iraq was the absence of either a viable plan or the necessary strength to enforce a Pax Americana in the Middle East.
America was powerful enough to destabilize the existing regional order, but not powerful enough to establish a new one.
The US neocons, with their wishful thinking, grossly underestimated the scale of the task at hand – unlike the revolutionaries in Iran, who quickly moved in to reap what the US had sowed.
The Iraq war also marked the beginning of America’s subsequent relative decline.
Bush squandered a large part of America’s military strength in Mesopotamia for an ideological fiction – strength that is sorely missed in the region ten years later.
And there is no alternative to be seen without America.
While there is no causal link between the Iraq war and the Arab revolutions that began in December 2010, their implications have combined in a malign manner.
Since the war, the bitter enmities between Al Qaeda and other Salafist and Sunni Arab nationalist groups have given way to cooperation or even mergers.
This, too, is a result brought about by the American neocon masterminds.
And the regional destabilization triggered by the Arab revolutions is increasingly converging on Iraq, mainly via Syria and Iran.
Indeed, the gravest current danger to the region is a process of national disintegration emanating from the Syrian civil war, which is threatening to spread not only to Iraq, but also to Lebanon and Jordan.
What makes Syria’s civil war so dangerous is that the players on the ground are no longer its driving forces. Rather, the war has become a struggle for regional dominance between Iran on one side and Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey on the other.
As a result, the Middle East is at risk of becoming the Balkans of the twenty-first century – a decline into regional chaos that began with, and was largely the result of, the US-led invasion ten years ago.

Winning at Corporate Governance
CAMBRIDGE: Despite NASDAQ crashes and the threat of US recession, the New Economy is here to stay.
Indeed, it remains the key to improved performance in Europe and Japan in the years ahead.
But where, exactly, does the heart of the New economy lie?
Is it in more competitive labor markets or in better tax systems or in deregulation?
Corporate governance, too, is a motor of the New Economy that should not be underrated.
If managers create productive, flexible structures focused on wealth creation, companies find it easy to adjust and explore new sources of productivity and cost control.
If decentralization and risk taking are part of a company’s mission, innovation in products and processes is certain to take place.
If, on the contrary, bosses behave like cautious executors of a wealthy estate, their companies will soon look like museums.
A country’s economic performance, indeed, is a mirror image of its resident companies.
Countries with great companies show great performance.
Where then are the great companies of the world to be found?
No surprise that more than half of the most respected companies are American.
Although Europe is roughly the same economic size as the US, it has far fewer winning corporate teams.
Japan may be much smaller than America or Europe, but it underperforms its share of G7 income or wealth.
The picture could not be clearer: the US economy performs stunningly, as does its corporate sector; Europe is far behind; and Japan does not really register.
Peering into the future of this premier league of companies five years from now, the FT sees a number of shifts as likely, with Europe catching up, Japan losing even more ground, and America giving up some ground, too.
This glimpse into the future mirrors today’s perceptions of a maturing (a code-word for losing its edge) American economy and a Europe able to play catch-up because the new business culture is at last taking hold.
This survey also accurately reflects the reality that very few Japanese firms are succeeding at the hard task of restructuring, of shifting to modern, world-class governance.
World-class Sony stays ahead; NTT ( its Docomo subsidiary is the key here) holds on, but old and tired Honda and Matsushita are likely to be relegated to second class status.
The dynamics of the next 5 years will also reflect a head-on competition between winning corporations.
Boeing versus Airbus may be the most interesting example.
In the current rankings, both are locked in a clinch close to the bottom of the FT list of top firms.
In 5 years, however, Airbus will likely be up and Boeing out of the champions league altogether.
Why?
Airbus has looked ahead, invested, and is bringing on a new Jumbo jet that will make Boeing’s existing products look outdated and inefficient.
For Boeing became complacent and forgot that the airline business is a cut-throat world.
When thinking about economic potential, we tend to look at the quality of the labor force, a people’s willingness to work, and the level of education.
Seen from this perspective, Europe and Japan should trounce the US because of their far superior basic education systems, and Japanese discipline make Europeans look lazy.
In fact, effort and education are not what matters most.
Far more significant is the economic environment in which people work – a market economy versus some form of socialism – and the organization of businesses in which they participate.
The best model of corporate governance to produce strong and lasting economic performance remains to be found.
In the 1980s, respect for the long-run view of the Japanese model ran high.
This is no longer so because of Japan’s economic malaise.
Then there was the flirtation with the German model of business-banking integration, which brings capital markets in-house.
That lost its attraction when it became clear that cozy relations between bankers and bosses result in tolerance for poor rates of return on capital.
Now the US model is in: decentralized, lean on middle management, tough on the CEO; and with a “don’t take no for an answer” code.
But this won’t be the last answer, although for the time being it will drive corporate restructuring and the managerial mind.
All this begs the question as to whether it makes sense to change corporate cultures every 10 or 20 years.
The pragmatic answer is that it takes very different models to handle a stable and stationary world as opposed to a world in which deregulation and technology produce dramatic change daily.
The US model works in times of rapid, pervasive change.
This is what lies ahead for the foreseeable future. Hold on tight.

Winning the Confidence Game
NEW HAVEN – On April 2, the G-20 will hold a summit in London to discuss what we may hope will be an internationally coordinated plan to address the world economic crisis. But can such a plan really work?
The basic problem, of course, is confidence.
People everywhere, consumers and investors alike, are canceling spending plans, because the world economy seems very risky right now.
The same thing happened during the Great Depression of the 1930’s.
A contemporary observer, Winthrop Case, explained it all in 1938: economic revival depended “on the willingness of individual and corporate buyers to make purchases that necessarily tie up their resources for a considerable length of time.
For the individual, this implies confidence in the job, and in the end comes equally back to the confidence of industry leaders.”
Unfortunately, confidence did not return until World War II ended the depression.
If the leaders meeting in London are to succeed where governments failed in the 1930’s, they must commit themselves to a fiscal target that is sufficient to restore full employment under normal credit conditions.
They must also commit themselves to a credit target that will restore lending to normal.
People will not spend normally unless they have both a job and normal access to credit.
During the Great Depression, such targets were not used on a large enough scale, merely fueling public despair that stimulus policies would ever work.
The G-20 Summit should also be an occasion for affirming some basic principles.
Confidence isn’t built up on the basis of spending or lending alone.
People need to believe that the money represents something more lasting than stimulus measures, which may eventually end in failure.
After all, the Great Depression did not end simply because of the massive stimulus of war-related expenditures.
Why should World War II have produced any confidence in the future?
To be sure, World War II reduced the unemployment rate in the United States dramatically, from 15% in 1940 to 1% in 1944, and had a similar effect in other countries. But this was not because of a revival in business confidence.
It was because of a nasty war, plain and simple, with people drafted into fighting, or into industries supplying the war effort.
The real recovery of confidence did not occur until after World War II, when the world did not sink back into depression.
The US Council of Economic Advisors warned of this possibility in 1949, and it was not alone.
There appears to be more than one reason why, on the contrary, confidence came roaring back.
First, there was a general perception of “pent-up demand.”
After years of privation (and in many countries the physical destruction of war), people just wanted to live normally – to rebuild, own a home, a car, and other consumer goods.
The widespread impression that there was such pent-up demand also led people to believe that there could not be another depression.
The perception of pent-up demand was like a powerful economic stimulus package, and it had the advantage that people believed it would be long-lasting.
Indeed, the same long-term confidence triggered the post-war “baby boom.”
According to some contemporary observers, however, “pent-up demand” was only part of the story.
During the brief but deep recession of 1949, the financial commentator Silvia Porter reflected on the attitudes that led to the 1929 crash: “We saw nothing wrong – in fact, we saw everything right – with the wild speculative boom and credit inflation that…culminated in the now almost unbelievable gambling orgy of 1929.”
But now, Porter wrote, after the depression and war, “We began to listen to the idea that a hundred million citizens, acting through a central government, could achieve much more than a hundred million acting as separate selfish units.
We developed, in short, a new attitude toward the responsibilities of government.”
She concluded that the positive effect of “pent-up demand” and government measures can “make sense only when viewed against the background of our changed economic and political philosophy.”
The Marshall Plan, which operated from 1947 to 1951, became a symbol of this new attitude.
The US gave billions of dollars of aid to rebuild war-ravaged countries in Europe.
The plan was widely viewed as reflecting a new kind of enlightenment, a recognition of the importance of supporting people who needed help.
Europe would not be allowed to languish, and the stimulus came from abroad.
After the war, Keynesian economic theory, which was generally not accepted or understood during the Great Depression, became the basis of a new social compact.
It was a theory that was perfectly suited to a generation that had just endured exceptional sacrifices, for it reaffirmed a belief in our responsibility for each other.
The effect of economic stimulus is redoubled by this kind of inspirational belief.
That is why all of the commitments made and intentions expressed at the upcoming G-20 summit matter.
The countries represented must show a generous spirit and make the world economy work for all people.
Seemingly peripheral issues, like aid to the developing world and the poor, who suffer the most from a crisis like this one, will be part of the primary story of the renewal of confidence, just as the Marshall Plan was part of that story after World War II.

Winning the Peace
Afghanistan’s future hangs in the balance as its weak national government struggles to maintain support and legitimacy in the face of a widening insurgency, warlords, the heroin trade, and a disappointed populace.
Across an arc extending from Afghanistan to East Africa, violence now also surges in Iraq, Lebanon, Somalia, and beyond, to Sudan’s Darfur region.
Everywhere, politicians, generals, and even diplomats talk of military strategies and maneuvers, but everywhere something utterly different is needed.
Stability will come only when economic opportunities exist, when a bulging generation of young men can find jobs and support families, rather than seeking their fortune in violence.
We are seeing again and again that a foreign army, whether NATO’s in Afghanistan, America’s in Iraq, Israel’s in occupied Palestine, or Ethiopia’s in Somalia, may win a battle, or even a war, but never the peace.
Peace is about dignity and hope for the future.
Military occupation saps dignity, and grinding poverty and economic disarray sap hope.
Peace can be achieved only with a withdrawal of foreign troops, and the arrival of jobs, productive farms and factories, tourism, health care, and schools.
Without these, military victory and occupation quickly turn to ashes.
The United States government has proven itself blind to these facts, but the international community also remains ill equipped to assist in the restoration of peace following conflicts in impoverished countries.
Repeatedly, a fragile peace has broken down because of the lack of economic follow-up.
Despite grand promises of foreign aid, economic reconstruction, and development in Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon, and elsewhere, the actual record of international assistance to post-war reconstruction is gravely deficient.
The scenario has become painfully familiar.
A war ends. An international donors’ conference is called.
Pledges of billions of dollars are announced.
A smiling new head of state graciously thanks the international community, including the occupying power.
Months pass.
World Bank teams from Washington start to arrive.
But actual reconstruction and recovery is delayed, perhaps for years.
Crony businesses from the US and Europe, which are utterly unfamiliar with local conditions, squander time, aid funds, and opportunities.
Two or three years pass.
The grand pronouncements become a pile of out-of-date World Bank studies.
Recriminations fly, the occupying army remains, and a new insurgency spreads.
Many factors contribute to this disarray, beginning with the shocking inability of the US, Europe, and the international organizations to understand things from the perspective of poor and displaced people.
Their lack of empathy is deplorable, but there are conceptual problems as well.
The international agencies involved in post-conflict reconstruction have so far failed to understand how to start or restart economic development in a low-income setting.
It’s important to distinguish four distinct phases of outside help to end a conflict.
In the first phase, during the war itself, aid is for humanitarian relief, focusing on food, water, emergency medicine, and refugee camps.
In the second phase, at the war’s end, aid remains mainly humanitarian relief, but now directed towards displaced people returning home, and to decommissioned soldiers.
In the third phase, lasting three to five years, aid supports the first phase of post-war economic development, including restoration of schools, clinics, farms, factories, and ports.
In the fourth phase, which can last a generation or more, assistance is directed to long-term investments and the strengthening of institutions such as courts.
The international community, and the US in particular, is dreadful at the third stage.
Once a conflict is over, aid agencies seem paralyzed.
Instead of sending help, they send study groups.
There is often a lag of years before moving from humanitarian relief to real economic development.
By the time such help actually arrives, it is often too late: war has been re-ignited.
In fact, it is possible to restart economic development through targeted “quick-impact” initiatives.
Since the economies of most impoverished post-conflict countries are based on agriculture, restarting farm output is vital.
Impoverished farmers should receive a free package of seeds, fertilizers, and low-cost equipment (such as pumps for irrigation).
When such aid is made available quickly, former soldiers will return to their farms, and can establish a livelihood by the beginning of the first growing season following the end of hostilities.
This type of aid does not require long studies, but quick action.
Similar quick-impact measures should be undertaken to control disease.
Small rural clinics can be built or rebuilt very quickly, within the first year of peace.
Solar panels and wind turbines can provide off-grid power in isolated rural areas.
Wells and cisterns can be put in place to ensure safe drinking water.
These and similar efforts can mean the difference between famine and food security, epidemic disease and health, income and utter poverty, and, most importantly, hope and despair.
Yet the window of opportunity closes quickly.
Quick-impact economic development is exactly what is needed now to help end the horrific violence and suffering in Darfur.
Sanctions, threats, and peacekeepers are only short-term measures, whereas real progress there against extreme poverty is not only achievable, but also is something that the government and rebels can agree on.
The same applies in Somalia.
But the window of opportunity closes quickly in these and other post-conflict regions.
Only by taking quick, meaningful action to fight hunger, poverty, and disease can there be a chance of creating conditions for long-term peace.

Winning the Transition
WASHINGTON, DC – Is the Arab Spring turning into a gloomy autumn?
With brutal crackdowns in Syria, a bloody civil war in Libya, and Yemen teetering on the brink of chaos, the number of skeptics is growing.
Although Egypt and Tunisia’s pro-democracy movements achieved rapid regime change, uncertainties remain in those countries, too.
After a brief period of hope, many observers now wonder whether the region is capable of producing viable, and economically vibrant, democracies.
Revolutions and their aftermaths, of course, are always fluid and fickle times, and the outcome is often perched on a knife’s edge.
Bridging the vast gap between high expectations and the reality of limited budgets and capabilities is a test in itself.
Redressing past injustice and building an economy that offers opportunity to all are major challenges as well, fraught with volatility, uncertainty, and the dangers of political opportunism.
But transitions are also times of great opportunity.
In the 1990’s, I was among those Indonesians who demanded and celebrated the departure of our own autocrat, Suharto, and I joined the new government when he left.
Many observers predicted that Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim country, would be unable to sustain democracy and would ultimately decline into chaos.
The task ahead of us was daunting.
But we proved the skeptics wrong, and learned some fundamental lessons.
Perhaps most importantly, we learned that there is no one-size-fits-all solution for democratization.
Each of the countries of the Middle East and North Africa will face unique challenges, which will have to be addressed on their own terms.
Even so, they all must make a real and symbolic break with the past.
The new authorities must send strong signals that the old ways are finished.
Change must be formally manifested, with new laws that are widely publicized.
Legislation that empowers citizens with freedom of expression, free and independent elections, and freedom of association is crucial, and it must be made clear to the public that no one is above the law.
Anything less will undermine the transition.
Moreover, corruption is the bane of development everywhere, so new governments should move fast to establish institutions and procedures to fight it.
Transparency and accountability are powerful ideas with near-universal support, which means that new leaders should not give up when the fight becomes difficult.
Civil-society organizations, local communities, representatives of the poor and vulnerable, and women play a vital role in this regard, and they should be included at every level of decision-making.
In Indonesia, we signed a hundred laws in less than 18 months, covering everything from media freedom to elections, corruption, decentralization, and anti-trust rules.
We ratified new public-finance legislation and ensured the independence of the country’s central bank.
New leaders must also expect and manage setbacks.
In post-revolutionary times, expectations are high, and the obstacles to meeting them are enormous.
I know from personal experience that we did not always have the luxury of getting the best outcomes.
We had to compromise and settle for the best possible results.
Security threats are among the most serious setbacks in transitions.
Nationalistic sentiment is strong, and politicians and interest groups can exploit it.
Often, the security forces are holdovers from the old regime, and there is no independent judicial system.
Reforms will take time, and the old bureaucracies may not be able to implement them.
In Indonesia, we used various innovations to work around such dilemmas.
For example, we appointed an independent judge to take over the bankruptcy and corruption courts, because career judges were too tainted.
Likewise, when we started cash-for-work programs as part of our pro-poor agenda, we asked communities to run these initiatives.
More broadly, new leaders are well advised to ensure that the economy performs well.
It is important to restore economic activity and create a favorable environment for entrepreneurs, particularly small and medium-size businesses, which constitute the main engine of job creation.
The recent revolutions, it should be recalled, started with the self-immolation of a Tunisian fruit vendor, who was harassed and insulted by the authorities.
But economic success without accountability and social inclusion is not sustainable, and new governments often must face tough choices in order to protect the poor and vulnerable.
They might have to abolish mis-targeted subsidies to free up resources for more targeted and efficient anti-poverty and job-creation programs.
In Indonesia, we had to draw a line between the very poor and the near-poor.
We could not afford to raise salaries or provide subsidies for everybody.
Our help had to be targeted.
So, while we helped the neediest, we excluded others who were not poor enough to benefit.
This was a tough and unpopular choice.
Finally, countries in transition need support – not only money, but also technical know-how to implement highly complex reforms.
When I became Indonesia’s finance minister, I had 64,000 employees.
But when we had to modernize our tax system, we could not find the required expertise anywhere in our country.
Yes, we needed external assistance, but we never surrendered “ownership” of the reform process; we made it work for us.
If we Indonesians had not been in charge of our own transition, it could easily have failed.
That lesson, too, is one that all countries in transition should bear in mind.

Winning with Opium in Afghanistan
Despite considerable effort by the international community in Afghanistan since 2001 to eliminate the Taliban and al Qaeda, the insurgency in the south of the country has gathered momentum at breakneck speed in recent months.
Our field research shows that we are not winning the campaign for the hearts and minds of the Afghan people – the Taliban are.
Indeed, the international community’s methods of fighting the insurgency and eradicating poppy crops have actually helped the insurgents gain power.
The international community has so far pursued policies of destruction, rather than the promised reconstruction.
The aggressive United States-led counter-narcotics policy of crop eradication has failed to win the support of Afghans, because it has triggered a chain reaction of poverty and violence in which poor farmers, with their only livelihood destroyed, are unable to feed their families.
This has been exacerbated by the failure to provide even the most basic aid and development in the country’s poorest areas.
At the same time, communities have been torn apart as a result of bombing campaigns, which have destroyed the very homes we came to protect.
This, in addition to four years of drought, has forced entire families to leave their villages for makeshift internal refugee camps.
You do not win people over by bombing them, but by helping them.
The Taliban have exploited the failures of the international community in extremely effective anti-Western propaganda that has fueled significant doubt in the minds of the public concerning the reasons justifying the international presence in Afghanistan.
Sadly, our troops are often the first to pay the price – sometimes with their lives.
It is not too late to win back the hearts and minds of the Afghan people.
International troops are excelling in an exceptionally hostile environment, but this is not a war that will be won by military means alone.
With public perception a crucial factor in winning the war, and the Taliban poised to launch a large military initiative next spring, failure to adopt a successful local strategy could signify the last chance the international community will have to build a secure and stable Afghanistan.
But a successful strategy – one that responds to Afghanistan’s extreme poverty crisis –requires that the international community reverse course on crop eradication.
In fact, the eradication of poppy crops not only damage local communities and undermines the international community’s goals, but it is also failing: opium production last year was at an all-time high.
In September, the United Nations Office on Drugs Crime announced that poppy cultivation soared by a record-high 60%.
Eradication will never be successful in Afghanistan, because it destroys the single crop that will grow in the south’s harsh climate – and thus serves as the main source of income to millions of people.
So a new, long-term, economically sustainable solution is urgently needed – one that directly engages with the communities that are suffering most – in order to achieve the support of the deeply impoverished rural population.
As a way to address this dilemma, the Senlis Council is proposing to run scientific pilot projects to research an opium licensing system for Afghanistan, which would be a core component of the economic reconstruction process.
A system in which poppy is cultivated under license for the production of pain-killing medicines such as morphine and codeine would allow farmers to pursue their traditional livelihood and way of life, and, more importantly, to feed themselves and their families.
There is a global shortage of morphine and codeine, particularly in underdeveloped countries, where these vital medicines are often in short supply, if not completely unavailable.
Not only would poppy licensing address the poverty and hunger crises that have engulfed the south of Afghanistan; it also would stabilize existing local structures, giving communities a reason to support President Hamid Karzai’s government and the international community.
Farmers would gain a sense of ownership in counter-narcotics efforts, in sharp contrast to the current idealistic – and evidently un-achievable – policy of crop eradication.
We must have the backing of the Afghan people if we are to defeat the Taliban.
By endorsing such an initiative, the international community would demonstrate that it is in Afghanistan for the good of the local population, which would help farmers sever ties with the insurgency.
But for such a system to be successful, the extreme poverty in the south of the country must first be our top priority.
According to the World Food Program, 70% of the population lack food security.
An immediate injection of emergency food and medical aid is urgently needed to break the vicious circle of suffering and violence.
Only then could a new, long-term development strategy in Afghanistan – one that admits that the international community is not winning the war, and that the status quo is unacceptable – be implemented.
Licensing the opium crop would be a realistic and pragmatic cornerstone of that strategy’s success.

Withdrawing from the War on Drugs
GENEVA –Switzerland’s direct democracy allows citizens who have gathered enough petition signatures to challenge government policies and laws in nationwide referenda.
After a spate of AIDS deaths during the 1980’s, the Swiss came face to face with a problem that has destroyed millions of lives in the United States, Russia, Latin America, the European Union, southern Asia, and other regions.
Intravenous drug users – especially heroin addicts – had turned public spaces in Zurich and other Swiss cities and towns into needle parks.
AIDS proved itself to be blind to affluence.
The Swiss did not respond with the kind of neglect that Russia’s government has shown so far toward its heroin and HIV epidemics – more than two million drug users and an estimated one million people living with HIV, over 60% of them infected while sharing contaminated needles.
Nor did the Swiss react with a “war on drugs” and massive funding for more policing, more jails, and mandatory prison sentences.
That war is well and truly lost.
The US now incarcerates more people than any other country, largely as a result of soaring drug convictions, with a disproportionate number of African-American and Hispanic prisoners.
The war on drugs has enabled drug cartels to reap higher profits than ever and transform entire communities in Latin America into fiefdoms.
Drug money is corrupting democratic governments and law-enforcement institutions around the world.
Drug-related violence has consumed untold numbers of victims in Afghanistan, Burma, Colombia, the US, and Mexico.
The Swiss re-examined their government’s drug policies with a pragmatic eye.
Health professionals took the lead in a campaign to press the government – through the mechanisms of direct democracy – to shift its focus from arresting and punishing drug users toward public-health policies that are based on scientific evidence of what works.
The Swiss implemented methadone programs. and, in order to prevent the spread of HIV, they created needle exchanges, including in prisons, and established safe injection rooms on a large scale.
The Swiss Federal Office of Public Health also oversaw an experiment in prescribing heroin to people who had lived with opiate dependency for significant periods.
The Swiss government’s careful evaluation of this approach demonstrated that heroin-assisted therapy is both feasible and cost-effective, and that it can bring patients significant health improvements.
Moreover, it contributed to a startling drop in drug-related crime.
The Swiss public was so convinced of the benefits of heroin-assisted therapy that, in two nationwide votes, voters endorsed the policy, despite domestic political opposition and criticism from the International Narcotics Control Board.
Switzerland is a conservative country.
Trafficking in illicit narcotics remains illegal.
In November 2008, the Swiss rejected a proposal for Dutch-style decriminalization of cannabis.
And some policymakers question whether the Swiss approach has focused drug policy too much on public health and too little on dealing with the poverty and social exclusion faced by drug users.
Switzerland’s pragmatic approach to drug abuse has nonetheless yielded significant lessons that are applicable to the US, Russia, and the many other drug- and HIV/AIDS-ravaged countries over which they wield significant influence.
So have similar approaches in Portugal, which only a decade ago led the EU in drug-related HIV/AIDS cases.
Portugal’s decision in 2001 to decriminalize possession of illegal drugs led not only to more drug users in treatment (rather than in prison), but also a significant decrease in the number of drug users newly infected with HIV.
One lesson is the crucial importance of using scientifically rigorous investigation of new programs – rather than populist rhetoric, religious moralizing, and urban myth – to guide policymaking.
This requires coordinating policing and health programs within a coherent policy framework, investing in research and public education on drug policy, opening new programs to independent review, and standing up to ideological criticism, both domestic and international, with evidence and pragmatism.
To convey these and other significant lessons, and to advocate worldwide for effective harm-reduction policies – and for broader public debate about more efficient and humane drug policies – we and other world leaders have initiated the Global Commission on Drug Policy, which held its inaugural meeting in Geneva in January.
Our aim is to show that the war on drugs is lost.
Switzerland, Portugal, and other countries have demonstrated that there is a better way forward, combining pragmatism and cost effectiveness with compassion and respect for human rights.

The Western Alliance in the Digital Age
MUNICH – This weekend, Helmut Schmidt and Henry Kissinger will participate in a discussion at the Munich Security Conference (MSC) – just as they did a half-century ago, when they took part in the first “Internationale Wehrkunde-Begegnung” (the forerunner of today’s conference).
In the meantime, many developments around the world have given us reason to rejoice – but also to reflect.
It is not only the crises extending from Ukraine to Syria that will prevent the MSC, the fiftieth, from becoming an exercise in self-celebration.
The transatlantic partnership, traditionally the backbone of the conference, has seen better days than these.
The United States has now at least recognized that a great deal of trust has been lost in recent months, owing to the scale of surveillance undertaken by its National Security Agency.
President Barack Obama’s speech about reforms of US intelligence-gathering activities, as well as his subsequent interview on German television, represented a first attempt to regain the confidence of America’s allies. But it signals, at most, the beginning of an intensive transatlantic dialogue on the issue.
The topic is too broad to be discussed solely among governments and secret services.
What we need is a more comprehensive international debate that engages, say, the American and German publics, as well as the US Congress and the German Bundestag – in short, an intra-Western debate about our relationship in the digital age.
In 1963, when Ewald von Kleist invited participants to Munich for the first conference, which Americans fondly call the “Wehrkunde” to this day, the motivating idea was to invite our most important allies to a discussion about the major strategic issues directly affecting Germany and NATO.
The main topic, at that time, was the Atlantic Alliance’s nuclear strategy.
After all, Germany would have been the first victim of a nuclear confrontation between NATO and the Warsaw Pact countries.
Kleist wanted to contribute to the creation of a German “strategic community,” which could make its own contributions to the NATO debate, rather than just absorbing whatever their technologically superior US ally proposed.
In a way, we are in a similar situation today.
Though the security implications of the digital age are less tangible and not as destructive as a nuclear attack, the technological possibilities fundamentally alter the playing field of international relations.
The revelations concerning the NSA’s surveillance activities are just the start.
A future of “thinking drones” and defensive and offensive cyber weapons raises new ethical, legal, and political questions.
We Europeans need to be self-critical and admit that we are not only lagging behind in terms of technical capabilities; we are also in danger of not fully grasping in time the possibilities and dangers of the digital world.
And of course, we will hardly be able to engage in meaningful negotiations with the Americans on cyber issues unless we succeed in establishing a united stance within the European Union.
Doing so would put us in far better position to negotiate on equal terms with the US, just as we can on trade issues.
In the past, the Western allies’ participation in NATO and its Nuclear Planning Group accommodated their concerns and prevented them from becoming mere objects of US strategy. Today, we need similar initiatives with regard to the digital world.
Those hoping to achieve true cooperation must be willing to make their own contributions.
This year’s MSC will include not only security officials from many countries. Three dozen German MPs and a significant US Congressional delegation will also participate.
That is why the conference is an excellent opportunity to step up the transatlantic debate. After all, let’s be honest: there will be real changes in US intelligence agencies’ behavior only if Congress regulates their activities more strictly.
The revelations and resulting debates in recent months have shown that many US politicians are also uneasy about the liberties taken by the secret services.
However, without domestic pressure, little will change.
It is all the more important that societal stakeholders – companies, NGOs, or international commissions of experts – both here and in the US become more heavily involved than before.
This issue affects us all.
The debate is not – and should not be – between Europe and the US. Some Americans are grateful for Edward J. Snowden’s revelations about the NSA, which they believe have stimulated urgently needed public deliberation.
The institutionally assured possibility of self-criticism is, arguably, the West’s best characteristic – its outstanding trait.
Our democracies are better organized than other systems to scrutinize their own policies and respond to criticism.
In the 1960’s, the West had to agree on a common strategy for the nuclear age, and learn to deal with the atomic threat.
Subsequently, we were able to take the first steps toward arms control and disarmament.
Today, we need a similar debate in the West regarding our strategy for the digital age if we want to overcome new challenges without denying our identity as liberal democracies.
This weekend in Munich, the Schmidts and Kissingers of today and tomorrow will have an opportunity to engage in what is probably the most important strategic debate of our time: how to prevent the West from falling apart inthe digital age.

Germany’s Same Old Foreign Policy
MUNICH – More than ten weeks after its general election, Germany continues to be without a new government. But, though the post-election coalition negotiations have been unusually prolonged, there is little disagreement between the parties over foreign and security policy.
Indeed, when Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party (SPD) finally presented their coalition agreement on November 27, the working group on foreign and security policy had been finished with its job for two weeks.
Except for a few tweaks that generally resonate more at home than with Germany’s European and international partners (such as requiring the government to be more transparent concerning arms exports to autocratic regimes), continuity and caution will remain the watchwords of German foreign and security policy.
Observers may disagree about whether German leaders’ stance provides a welcome sign of reliability or reflects a lamentable lack of diplomatic ambition.
Those who hope for more active German leadership may well be disappointed by the new government.
Big ideas, or even big questions, are notably absent from the coalition agreement.
This is very much a reflection of many Germans’ views about themselves and their future: they are comfortable with the status quo, see no need for further reform proposals, are not interested in grand strategy, and would largely prefer to be left alone.
Consider NATO policy.
Successive German governments have maintained that the alliance should be, or even is, the place to discuss and decide on key security challenges. But Germany has at times been rather reluctant to take crisis issues to NATO headquarters.
And when it comes to provision of military and civilian security beyond what the coalition agreement calls “our geographic neighborhood,” the incoming government will favor enabling other regional organizations to do the job.
Or consider the question of Turkey’s accession to the European Union.
Continuing disagreement between the coalition partners will not permit a proactive German role. Instead, the compromise solution will be no solution: neither yes nor no.
At the same time, some interesting new perspectives appear in the coalition agreement.
For starters, the United States’ strategic “pivot” to the Asia-Pacific region is described as an opportunity for Europe to assert a coordinated foreign policy that finally plays a role in the development of cooperative policies in the region.
Moreover, to encourage this outcome, the coalition agreement promises that the government will “adopt new initiatives to strengthen and deepen the Common Foreign and Security Policy” after the EU summit in December 2013.
It includes a call for an annual European Council session on security and defense, as well as for a strategic debate about the purpose of EU foreign relations.
In addition, the German government will support European defense integration and maintain the establishment of a European army as a long-term goal.
This may not amount to much in practice, but the language in this section is much less tepid than elsewhere.
Finally, the coalition agreement responds to concerns about Germany’s ability to be a reliable partner in NATO and EU military missions in a potentially more integrated EU defense organization.
According to a 1994 ruling by Germany’s Constitutional Court, the German parliament has the final say when it comes to deploying soldiers.
However, Germany’s partners will hardly agree to integrate forces further if the German parliament were to retain a veto over their deployment.
The coalition partners disagree about how urgent it is to sort out this issue.
Nonetheless, they have agreed that, within a year, a commission will provide different options and models to protect the German parliament’s rights while providing assurances to Germany’s European partners that the country will be a reliable contributor to troop deployments.
Should the SPD, which will vote on the coalition agreement in early December, block the formation of the new government (an unlikely development but not entirely out of the question), disputes over security and defense affairs would not be the culprit.
Aside from a few minor particulars, consensus prevails.
For some, that is a cause for ambivalence.
“I do not like the idea that Germany plays itself up to impose its will on others,” German President Joachim Gauck said recently. “Yet neither do I like the idea that Germany plays itself down to eschew risks or solidarity.”
Whether German foreign policy can and should do more is a reasonable question.
To some degree, the new coalition will feel the pressure and consider the necessity to assume more responsibility for international leadership. But it will respond ever so slowly and ever so carefully.
The bottom line is this: Expect no surprises from Germany.
Considering how difficult it has been for some, if not most, other EU countries to deal with the challenges of the last five years, that is actually rather good news.

Wolfowitz and the World Bank at Bay
Will World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz’s troubles finally catalyze real change at the World Bank?
Will there finally be an end to the archaic practice by which the President of the United States unilaterally appoints the head of the world’s most important development agency?
Facing an extraordinary rebuke from the Bank’s ministerial oversight committee and open revolt from his professional staff, Wolfowitz has faint hope of limping through the last three years of his term.
The immediate uproar is over the exceedingly generous pay and promotion package that Wolfowitz awarded in 2005 to his girlfriend as compensation for leaving the Bank to pave the way for his arrival.
At a time when the Bank has been emphasizing high governance standards as the key to development, the recent revelation of that arrangement’s details have dealt a serious blow to the Bank’s credibility.
But even if Wolfowitz is eventually forced to resign, nothing will be gained if US President George W. Bush is allowed summarily to choose his replacement, as US Presidents have been doing ever since the Bank was founded after World War II.
Instead, the Bank’s head should be chosen in an open and transparent process that aims to select the best-qualified candidate, whether from the US, Europe, or the developing world.
Indeed, a big part of Wolfowitz’s weakness today is the way he came to his job, as an in-your-face appointment from a US administration weak at international cooperation.
The World Bank is a development finance institution.
But Wolfowitz’s background at the US State and Defense Departments gave him no real expertise or experience in either area.
Instead, his claim to fame was his role as architect of America’s failed war in Iraq.
By all accounts, Wolfowitz is brilliant, but it seems inconceivable that an open, transparent, and multilateral selection process would have chosen him to head the World Bank.
I reach this conclusion even though I am sympathetic to the Bush administration’s desire to catalyze change at the Bank.
I have long advocated shifting the Bank’s center of gravity from lending to outright grants, a policy that the Bush administration strongly endorses.
But choosing someone with no obvious background or experience in economic development was not the way to make progress on this front.
A more open selection process, indeed, would have zoomed in on the fact that Wolfowitz’s girlfriend worked at the Bank.
This may seem a trivial issue, but it is not, given the Bank’s strong policies to protect against nepotism.
If Wolfowitz were otherwise overwhelmingly the most qualified candidate, the selection committee may have found a way to finesse the issue, openly and transparently.
But, given his questionable fit for the job in the first place, the girlfriend issue might have been disqualifying.
Why does the world meekly go along with the status quo and let the US dictate the Bank’s top position?
It is a sorry tale of poor global governance.
Europe does not get in America’s way because it wants to maintain Europe’s equally out-dated privilege of appointing the head of the International Monetary Fund, the Bank’s sister institution.
Asia has little choice but to defer to the US and Europe’s shenanigans because it is grossly under-represented in both organizations.
As for Africa, its leaders are loath to do or say anything that might interrupt the flow of World Bank largesse.
Many people, including myself, have long complained about the leadership selection process at the World Bank and the IMF.
How can the Bank and the Fund continue to go around lecturing developing economies on good governance and transparency but fail to allow change in their own houses?
Now and again, both organizations pay lip service to the issue.
But so far, they have exhibited no real desire for change.
To be fair, the IMF’s leadership is making a determined effort to give dynamic emerging economies, particularly in Asia, a bigger say in Fund governance.
If carried far enough, this process would ultimately catalyze the necessary changes.
Unfortunately, the IMF’s rebalancing efforts are proceeding at a glacial pace.
At the World Bank, nothing seems to be happening at all.
Perhaps when Gordon Brown becomes the UK’s next prime minister, he will be able to convince the G7 group of rich countries to lead the charge for change.
As head of the Fund’s ministerial oversight committee, Brown understands the issues as well as anyone.
Or perhaps the Wolfowitz debacle will prove to be the catalyst.
Maybe at last, the next World Bank or IMF president will come from outside their usual domains.
There are plenty of great potential non-American candidates.
South African Finance Minister Trevor Manuel has ably served as head of the World Bank’s oversight committee and would make a brilliant World Bank president.
And it still could be a qualified American.
What about Bill Clinton?
One way or the other, the Bank and the IMF leadership selection process urgently needs to be revamped.
What the Wolfowitz debacle tells us most clearly is that the time for patience with the status quo is over.

Women and Development
COPENHAGEN – A girl born in South Asia or sub-Saharan Africa faces a cruel double burden.
She will grow up in a region beset by poverty, disease, war or famine.
She will also confront these challenges with the added disadvantage of being female.
Although more attention is being given to gender issues, inequality persists in every culture, country, and continent.
A new study for the Copenhagen Consensus project shows that eliminating this disparity is an investment with high payoffs.
Despite global interest in education for all, many girls in poor countries continue to be denied basic education; right from the start, they are disadvantaged.
Three in five illiterate children in the world are girls.
Particularly in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, cultural norms and economic hardships stop parents from sending their daughters to school or from keeping them in school for as long as they enroll their sons.
This unequal investment is neither equitable nor efficient.
An obvious solution is to build more schools in places where girls and boys must be educated separately.
In poor Muslim countries like Pakistan, Yemen, and Morocco, single-sex schooling is the norm, but many rural areas can afford only one public school, which is usually set aside for boys.
In theory, about half of the education gap in these areas could be closed by building girls’ schools.
Elsewhere, supply constraints are not the problem.
Instead, policymakers must find ways to strengthen the incentives for parents to send their daughters to school.
In countries where the family’s cost of schooling girls is lowered either by a no-fee policy or by a stipend for girls who enroll in school, girls’ enrollment rate increases.
The experiences of these few countries lead us to propose a system whereby mothers are paid if their school-age daughters attend school regularly from the 3rd to the 9th grade.
This would increase girls’ enrollment and also put money into women’s hands – important because studies show that money given to women is more likely to provide positive nutritional and health benefits for their children than money given to men.
It also provides the women with greater bargaining power in their own households.
The annual cost per pupil would be $32.
Covering every eligible girl in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia for a year would cost $6 billion.
Benefits from increased future wages and the reduction in health-care use would be between three and 26 times higher.
Pregnancy is one of the most vulnerable times for poor women; 99% of the 529,000 women who die annually from pregnancy-related complications live in developing countries.
Severe malnutrition and the absence of prenatal care during pregnancy put both mother and child at serious risk.
Spending $3.9 billion on family planning and maternal health initiatives, such as provision of emergency contraception in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, could avert 1.4 million infant deaths and 142,000 pregnancy-related deaths in women.
Making reproductive services available to women who cannot afford to pay their way can help prevent these deaths. But such services must not shy away from promoting and providing modern contraceptive methods to avoid unwanted pregnancies.
Nearly 20% of women in developing countries report that they would like to stop having more children but are not using any form of contraception or family planning, possibly because reproductive services are not available.
For adolescent girls, early marriage or an unwanted pregnancy typically curtails schooling.
Delaying marriage and childbearing allows them to gain more education and perhaps more earning opportunities, as well as improved health, education, and labor market success for their future children – benefits worth ten times more than the cost of providing reproductive services.
Other tools, aside from schooling, can help women improve their income-earning ability.
Microfinance institutions, such as Bangladesh’s Grameen Bank, play a vital role in allowing self-employed women to build profitable businesses.
Small loans empower women by giving them more control over household assets and resources, more autonomy and decision-making power, and greater access to participation in public life.
Women are more likely than men to meet regular repayments and to spend their earnings on children’s health and education.
Policymakers should continue to facilitate the rollout of microfinance programs.
Studies show that each dollar loaned by a microfinance institution increases household expenditure by almost 10% in the first year, and that the benefits will continue for another 30 years.
Benefits are estimated to end up about six times higher than the costs.
Though women have the right to vote in almost every country, gender inequalities in political representation remain large.
Governments should consider gender quotas at the local level of politics.
Greater female representation may not necessarily lead to more emphasis on “female” policy priorities, but in India, village councils with gender quotas for village chiefs have higher levels of safe drinking water, better immunization coverage and roads, and less bribery.
There may be some losses from electing women because they tend to have less political experience than men, but the record in India suggests that if it took 20 years to establish a 30% share of women in local positions in other countries, the benefits would be at least double the costs of achieving this.
Being a woman need not and should not be among the greatest challenges of life.

Women and the American Presidential Campaign
OLYMPIA, WASHINGTON – Barack Obama and John McCain are the two contenders in America’s presidential election this year, but the campaign has also been dominated by two very different women, Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin.
Indeed, many observers believe that women will determine the election’s outcome.
So, to paraphrase Sigmund Freud, “What do American women want?”
Until the 1960’s, American women were more likely than men to support Republicans.
In the 1980 election, a different gender gap emerged, with women more likely than men to support Democrats.
In 1996, women’s support for Bill Clinton was 14 percentage points higher than men’s, and in 2000, women favored Al Gore over George W. Bush by 12 points.
But, since 1996, the political gender gap has been halved.
The women gravitating back to the Republicans, according to conventional wisdom, are “security moms” – suburban wives and mothers who started worrying about their families’ safety after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.
McCain’s selection of Palin was an attempt to appeal to these mothers and to pick up votes from women disappointed about Clinton’s loss.
In fact, the shift to Republicans since 2001 was largely confined to Southern white women.
In the nation as a whole, notes political scientist Karen Kaufmann, 50% of mothers with children voted for Bush in 2000, and this actually dipped to 49% in 2004.
But Southern white women, who were much more likely than Southern white men to support Bill Clinton in 1996 and Al Gore in 2000, were less likely than Southern men to support Democrat John Kerry in 2004.
There is now a bigger difference between the voting preferences of Southern white women and white women in the rest of the country than between men and women.
Outside the South, female voters are less likely to be hawkish on foreign policy and more likely to support spending on health, education, and other social-welfare programs.
Women also tend to be more sympathetic to efforts to reduce income inequality, although African-American men are just as “compassionate” on these issues as African-American women.
Can either party really win by appealing to gender?
Women do like to see other women emerge as leaders.
When the Democrats nominated Geraldine Ferraro for vice-president in 1984, she attracted huge crowds, just as Palin does today.
Shortly after Palin’s nomination, one in three white women said that they would be more likely to vote for McCain.
At first glance, it seems reasonable that political parties might be able to translate women’s gender consciousness into a unified voting bloc.
Women do have some common interests, especially with regard to controlling their own reproductive decisions and protecting themselves against sexual exploitation and rape.
Most women also recognize and resent that the media judge them more harshly than they judge men.
And, because women generally expect to bear most of the responsibility for nurturing children, they tend to evaluate social policies through this lens.
But how women address gender-based reproductive, sexual, and family interests varies by their class position and their personal options outside the family.
Women who compete in the labor market generally support efforts to challenge sexual double standards and vigorously prosecute sexual harassment.
But women who are more dependent upon a husband often accept a double standard that stresses female purity and male gallantry.
These women believe that adherence to stereotyped gender roles protects “good” women.
Similarly, women know that they are usually paid less and have less chance for professional advancement than men.
But they may choose different strategies for coping with these disadvantages.
Those who can or must support themselves outside marriage tend to favor expanding economic opportunities for women and to oppose laws and values that give familial authority to husbands and fathers.
By contrast, women with less economic autonomy may feel that their interests are best served by emphasizing family hierarchies and reciprocal duties.
Wifely deference may be seen as reinforcing the husband’s obligation to support the family.
Even on issues like contraception and abortion, women’s positions are sometimes influenced by conflicting assessments.
Women who plan to postpone marriage while building their careers are far more likely to want to ensure that they can avoid or end an unintended pregnancy.
But women who believe that their best hope for security is to find a husband often tell interviewers that if other women are allowed to escape the biological consequences of having sex, men will be less willing to offer marriage in return for it.
Likewise, women who want to stay home with their children tend to favor tax breaks or family subsidies, whereas women who want to combine work and family are more likely to support expanded childcare and guaranteed parental work leave.
In the long run, these differences outweigh women’s commonalities.
Palin’s approval ratings among women fell as they learned more about what she stands for.
The main reason some women – and even more men – are more likely to vote for a McCain-Palin combination is not because of Palin’s gender, but because her presence on the ticket reassures social conservatives of McCain’s willingness to accommodate their agenda.
Palin’s nomination, however, could have an unintended consequence on the gender views of social conservatives.
This summer, the Pew Research Center found that only 20% of Republicans said they would support a female candidate who had school-age children.
Today, those same Republicans seem to find nothing to criticize in the fact that Palin returned to work three days after the birth of her last child. In supporting a woman’s choice to combine motherhood with a demanding job, social conservatives now seem to agree with long-time feminists.

Arab Women’s Unfinished Revolution
FEZ – Though women across the Middle East participated actively in the Arab Spring protests that began in late 2010, they remain second-class citizens, even where popular uprisings managed to topple autocratic regimes.
Indeed, the Islamist governments now in power in several countries seem more determined than the despots that they replaced to keep women out of politics.
In conducting interviews with women in the region, I am struck by their overall pessimism.
They fear the loss of their rights.
They see economic disintegration all around them, raising the possibility of a further increase in violence.
As social bonds fray, they feel increasingly vulnerable.
More than once, I heard them express the view that things were better before the revolutions.
Female representation in parliaments and government cabinets after the Arab Spring has been either absent or meager, and women activists worry that Islamist parties will implement reactionary policies that discriminate on the basis of gender.
In Egypt, for example, the Freedom and Justice Party, which dominates the parliament, claims that a woman cannot become President.
Egyptian women were heavily represented in the protests that brought down former President Hosni Mubarak’s regime in 2011, but they have been largely excluded from any official decision-making role ever since.
In Morocco, while there were eightwomen in the previous cabinet, today there is only one in the Islamist-led government.
In January, the Islamist-dominated parliament adopted a decree lowering the age of marriage for girls from 18 to 16, a major setback.
Moroccan feminists have protested vigorously, but to no avail.
Parliamentary representation for women has also taken a hit.
Women hold less than 1% of seats in the current Egyptian parliament; previously, they held 12%.
In Libya, a first draft of the electoral law reserved 10% of seats in the constituent assembly for women, but the quota was later abandoned.
In Tunisia, the election in 2011 brought 49 women into the 217-seat Constituent Assembly.
But 42 of these women are members of Ennahda, which regards Sharia (Islamic law) as the source of legislation.
Long-time Tunisian activists fear that Ennahda, which dominates the assembly, will use the presence of women MPs to restrict women’s rights.
The recent assassination of the secular Tunisian opposition leader Chokri Belaid has raised the stakes for women there.
Belaid was a voice on behalf of women’s rights, and the threat of increased political violence will focus on those who advocate secular equality for all Tunisians, including women.
Unfortunately, conservative forces in the Arab world repeatedly turn against women when political unrest spreads.
In Bahrain, several women protesters have been arrested and tortured.
In Yemen, the authorities call on male relatives to “tame” their women.
In Tunisia, the most Westernized of the Arab countries, women have been attacked at universities and schools, and are being forced to wear the hijab.
A woman who was allegedly raped by two policemen in September 2012 was charged with public indecency when she filed a complaint.
Likewise, in Egypt, women protesters face greater scrutiny than men.
Those arrested by the military during the anti-Mubarak protests were subjected to virginity tests as a form of intimidation.
Across the Middle East, Islamist militias have harassed, arrested, raped, and tortured women pro-democracy activists.
The model of Iran’s Islamic Revolution in 1979, which imposed second-class citizenship on women, is frequently cited as a threat in Arab countries now ruled by Islamist parties.
These countries are at a crossroads.
Women make up half of the Middle East’s population, and any hope of political and economic development must account for that fact.
Organizations like the United Nations Development Program have repeatedly issued reports demonstrating the connection between economic decline and oppression of women.
Simply put, the Arab countries will not succeed unless women are fully integrated into political and economic life.
In her Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech in 2011, Yemeni political activist Tawakkol Karman, made the point clearly: “The solution to women’s issues can only be achieved in a free and democratic society in which human energy is liberated, the energy of both women and men together.”
Middle Eastern countries should protect and consolidate women’s rights as a way to reinforce democratic ideas and habits.
They must institute the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international laws and agreements in order to eradicate gender-based discrimination and violence.
The hope for women’s progress is really a hope for a decent society in which development for all is possible.

A Woman’s Place Is in the Digital Revolution
MONTREAL – Digital technologies are a double-edged sword for the world’s women.
Men’s greater access to these technologies puts women at risk of being left even further behind economically and socially. But if women can tap the full power of digital technologies, vital new opportunities will open up for them.
According to estimates by the GSM Association, women’s access to the Internet and mobile phones is about 85% of the level for men, on average, and a total of 1.7 billion women in low- and middle-income countries are unconnected. This severely limits the prospects of women and girls.
Digital technologies enhance women’s access to finance, with mobile banking enabling them to avoid long journeys to a branch or ATM.
Likewise, technology-enabled health care delivered via phone or tablet improves health outcomes, as it reaches women even in the remotest areas, sparing them a long and often risky trek to see a doctor.
The timesaving potential of digital technologies is so great that they may make the difference in enabling women to seek paid employment.
Today, women undertake three-quarters of all unpaid care work, producing output of around $10 trillion, or 13% of global GDP – none of which is translated into income, let alone economic power.
By their nature, e-commerce and technology-based businesses offer women more flexibility and autonomy, helping them to manage home responsibilities alongside paid work.
In Indonesia, women-owned businesses generate 35% of e-commerce revenue, compared with only 15% of the revenue of offline businesses.
Likewise, in China, 55% of new Internet businesses are founded by women, and Alibaba’s Taobao e-commerce platform has an equal number of male and female store owners.
In fact, China is home to 114 of the world’s 147 self-made female billionaires, compared to just 14 in the second-place country, the United States.
Women’s economic empowerment is good not just for the women who benefit.
The McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) has estimated that advancing gender equality could add $12 trillion per year to the world economy by 2025.
In the Asia-Pacific region alone, getting more women into full-time employment in higher-paid, higher-productivity sectors could add $4.5 trillion per year to GDP, 12% above the current trajectory.
At the company level, a growing body of evidence shows that more gender equality is good for bottom lines.
Greater diversity of leadership styles improves the quality of decision-making.
If given the opportunity, women could be leading innovators in the age of automation and artificial intelligence, and could help to ensure that algorithms are free of gender bias.
But major barriers prevent women from seizing these opportunities.
For example, in India, where only 29% of all Internet users are female, girls in rural areas often face gender-based restrictions on their use of information and communications technologies.
One village in Uttar Pradesh implemented a fine for any girl using a mobile phone outside the home.
Beyond the social attitudes that undermine women’s access to digital technologies, women and girls often disproportionately lack the requisite skills to seize the opportunities of the digital age.
In Singapore, for example, women lag behind men in education in science, math, engineering, and technology.
At Nanyang Technological University, females comprised only 27% of the undergraduate computer-science program in 2015-2016, despite accounting for half of all undergraduates at the university.
What is at stake is not just women’s ability to seize the opportunities offered by the digital revolution, but also their capacity to withstand the coming wave of automation.
According to MGI research, in Singapore alone, 800,000 full-time-equivalent jobs could be displaced by 2030 due to automation.
The jobs that are most vulnerable to automation are the low-paid, lower-skill jobs that women are more likely to hold.
At the same time, though automation risks disrupting many jobs (or tasks within jobs) for both men and women, it also takes some of the drudgery out of current work, tailoring it to human abilities.
The result could be higher wages that contribute to the creation of more new jobs – 300-365 million worldwide – as spending increases, with emerging economies gaining the most.
Furthermore, among the new jobs that will be created will be many in fields like education and health care, where women have traditionally thrived.
According to MGI research, more than 100 million jobs could be created over the next 10-15 years as health care and education needs grow.
It is not yet clear exactly how automation will affect women’s employment.
But there is no doubt that protecting – and even enhancing – women’s job and income prospects will require upgrading their skills, so that they can take advantage of the new and changing opportunities created by the ongoing digital revolution.
The success of women in e-commerce attests to the power of digital technologies to level the economic playing field, to the benefit of individual women, their communities and societies, and the world economy.
More women in work – particularly in the technology industries that are shaping our collective future – would be good news for all.

The Media’s #MeToo Problem
LONDON – Journalism classrooms may be dominated by women, but global media are still ruled by men, who occupy the majority of management positions, report more news stories and are more frequently presented as expert voices.
This imbalance is reflected in the content newsrooms produce, with fewer written words and broadcast seconds dedicated to telling women’s stories.
It is also reflected in the industry’s culture, which leaves women more vulnerable to sexual harassment and abuse.
Given the importance of relationship-building in media, not to mention the desire for connection among journalists who cover extreme or harrowing events in difficult environments, intimate ties can easily form among colleagues and associates.
The problem arises when these relationships turn sour or, worse, when they are non-consensual or based on coercion, such as when a more senior colleague pursues a sexual relationship with a subordinate.
Of course, across countries, there can be significant differences in what is considered predatory or inappropriate behavior.
But, globally, almost half of women journalists report having experienced work-related sexual harassment, according to a 2014 study by the International News Safety Institute (INSI) and the International Women’s Media Foundation (IWMF). Two-thirds reported that they had faced “intimidation, threats, or abuse,” mostly by bosses, supervisors, or co-workers.
For perpetrators, impunity remains the norm.
Almost three-fifths of respondents in the INSI/IWMF study who had experienced harassment said that they had reported incidents to their employers.
In most cases, however, it was the women who experienced the abuse who suffered adverse consequences: damaged reputations and career prospects, not to mention the impact on their psychological and emotional wellbeing.
So while men with histories of predatory behavior continue to occupy senior positions in the global news industry, women journalists are pushed to the point that they consider leaving it.
In a recent survey by the IWMF and TrollBusters, one-third of respondents said that they had considered abandoning journalism; those at earlier stages in their careers were twice as likely to say that they were considering work in other fields because of the threats and attacks they received, in person or online.
Despite the obstacles they face, more women appear to be rising in the ranks of the global media industry, even though progress is relatively slow.
In digital newsrooms, which often have fewer of the inherent inequities of legacy media, the number of women in leadership positions appears to be growing faster.
However, the “bro” culture in certain newer newsrooms carries its own sexual harassment risks for women.
Meanwhile, in the United States, several high-profile male journalists have lost their jobs in the last year over allegations of inappropriate behavior toward their female colleagues – part of the broader #MeToo movement.
But, overall, newsrooms continue to fail to take seriously the threats female journalists face on the job, both in their own workplaces and in the field.
While newsrooms conduct risk assessment and deployment discussions regarding journalists in the field – where women can be particularly vulnerable to unwelcome advances from male colleagues, contacts, or strangers – they rarely account for the specific threats women face, at least not in a sufficiently nuanced way.
This may be partly because, for major news organizations, these assessments are often handled in consultation with safety advisers – usually former military men, who may not fully appreciate the particular risks women face.
Sometimes, the safety advisers turn out to be perpetrators of sexual harassment. Anecdotally, I know of several journalists who have been sexually harassed by safety advisers.
Depending on where this takes place, such behavior can have significant security implications.
As if that were not enough pressure, female foreign correspondents who are assaulted in the field often find themselves at the center of debates about whether women should be deployed on certain stories at all.
Male correspondents are never the subjects of such debates.
This macho myopia reinforces the damaging imbalance in perspectives shaping the media. It also carries significant economic costs.
As the Harvard Business Review put it, “we all pay the price” when sexual harassment continues or is covered up.
By impeding women from advancing within the industry or compelling them to change jobs, harassment diminishes their earning potential and deprives society of the best use of its talents.
The fact is that journalists of various genders, ethnicities, and backgrounds experience different environments differently, in terms of both the risks they face and the rewards they can reap.
Any assessment of a story needs to account for that nuance, with managers choosing the best journalist for the job – and providing the support needed to keep all journalists safe.
To change the organizational culture that has enabled harassment and other forms of abuse against women – a moral obligation, as well as a legal and economic imperative – newsroom managers must lead from the top.
Change will not happen overnight, nor will it be driven by a single actor.
Leaders should listen to the women in their ranks, and invite diverse perspectives to help effect change.
The goal is not to pit young against old or women against men. It is to rectify the media industry’s failure to protect its most vulnerable workers.
We all pay when that failure prevents women journalists from achieving their full potential.

It’s Time to Let Women Thrive
DAVOS – In public debates around the world, women’s empowerment is increasingly being recognized as a top priority.
The question of how to provide more economic opportunities for women is firmly on the agenda at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos this year.
And longtime advocates for women are feeling energized, as countless others – men and women alike – have come to recognize the urgency of the task.
Affording women and girls the opportunity to succeed is not just the right thing to do; it can also transform societies and economies for the good of all.
For example, bringing women’s labor force participation up to the same level as that of men would boost GDP by as much as 9% in Japan and 27% in India.
The International Monetary Fund has documented many other macroeconomic benefits associated with women’s empowerment.
Reducing gender gaps in employment and education has been shown to help economies diversify their exports.
Appointing more women to banking-supervision boards can prevent cozy groupthink, thereby ensuring greater stability and resilience in the financial sector.
And reducing gender inequalities also reduces income inequality, allowing for more sustainable growth.
Closing the gender gap may seem like a tall order, but it is essential for long-term economic development and prosperity.
The challenge for every country, then, is to make the most of all of its people’s talents.
Realizing women’s potential is a universal mission.
But some of the barriers holding women back are also universal.
Astonishingly, almost 90% of countries have one or more gender-based legal restrictions on the books.
In some countries, women still have limited property rights compared to men; in others, husbands have the right to forbid their wives from working.
Beyond legal barriers, women also face social and cultural obstacles that limit their access to education, work, and finance.
This is especially true in countries with fragile political systems.
Now that public awareness of is growing, it is time to press ahead with concrete measures to help women remain in the workforce while raising a family.
For a glimpse of what that might look like, consider Norway, where affordable childcare and parental-leave schemes have proven successful in enabling both mothers and fathers to work.
Yes, these programs are costly.
But they are well worth the investment, given employed women’s enormous contribution to economic growth.
Moreover, programs that help women keep working also change the role of fathers.
In Norway and other countries with similar policies, fathers now share equally in parental leave and child-rearing.
As a result, more women can pursue leadership roles in work and public life.
Of course, countries that are not yet at Norway’s level of economic development typically face other gender-related challenges, including limited access to water and education.
Unfortunately, while many countries have made progress in reducing gender gaps in primary-school enrollment, there is still much more work to be done at the secondary and tertiary levels.
As long as these gaps persist, women will not be able to aspire to political and economic power on an equal footing with men.
Accordingly, Norway has made girls’ education a top priority in its international-development programs.
Beyond education, ensuring that women in developing countries have access to finance is critical, because it enables them to participate fully in the economy, including as entrepreneurs.
When women are empowered to start their own businesses, they can drive innovation and help their countries prosper.
Because women’s labor-force participation is so important for growth, organizations such as the IMF are committed to working with governments around the world to empower women economically.
IMF-supported programs in Egypt and Jordan, for example, include measures to boost investment in public nurseries and safe public transportation.
In addition to specific policies, today’s conversation has increasingly focused on the need for wider social change.
And now that movements such as #Equalpay and #MeToo have gained so much momentum, it looks like that change could be coming.
It has been inspiring to see so many women, girls, and – yes – men speaking out against retrograde attitudes toward women, which have been holding all of us back.
With the global economy recovering, governments must now lay the foundation for long-term growth, by creating the conditions for women everywhere to realize their full potential.
Discrimination and abuse against women can no longer stand.
It is time for women to thrive.

Women on Top?
What will G-8 summit meetings be like when American President Hillary Clinton and French President Ségolène Royal join German Chancellor Angela Merkel in a formidable triangle of women’s power?
The scenario is not altogether unlikely.
Indeed, in the United States and France, there are even alternative female candidates for the presidency (Condoleezza Rice in America, Michelle Alliot-Marie in France).
Will this mean a new style of both domestic politics and international relations?
The answer is not obvious.
After all, some women have long had the strength and the will to make it to the top.
Think of Indira Gandhi, Golda Meir, or Margaret Thatcher.
All three were powerful prime ministers of their countries, though perhaps not the epitome of what might be regarded as feminine values.
They all outdid men at their own game and had little time for what came to be called feminism.
Indeed, another trend may be more significant as far as political leadership is concerned.
When it comes to the formation of governments, women have managed to break out of the prison of their traditional domains, such as education and social affairs.
Foreign policy in particular has become a female aspiration.
Both the US and the European Union have women leading their foreign offices; so do half a dozen EU countries, including Britain.
Has this changed the style, indeed, the substance of foreign policy?
Undoubtedly, a shift in policy styles is occurring in many parts of the world.
In a word, it appears that the Reagan-Thatcher period is over.
While opponents of globalization still fight “neo-liberal” policies, political discourse has taken a new turn.
Words like “justice” are back in fashion; there is concern about globalization’s losers and the “underclass.”
Likewise, the leader of Britain’s Conservatives, David Cameron, startled more old-fashioned supporters of his party by saying that people released from prison “need, above all, love.”
When Prime Minister Tony Blair described the next election as a fistfight in which the “flyweight” Cameron would be carried out and the “heavyweight” Brown victorious after a short bout, he got much applause from his supporters in the House of Commons, but the remark went down badly with voters.
Somehow, people prefer “softer” values than were prevalent in the last two decades.
Yet it is not the leading women who above all represent these values.
Merkel may have been softened by having to preside over a grand coalition, but her original stance was more of the Reagan-Thatcher variety.
Yuliya Tymoshenko was clearly the most stouthearted among the leaders of Ukraine’s Orange Revolution, and no one has ever described Hillary Clinton as particularly “soft.”
On the contrary, her possible Republican opponent in 2009, Senator John McCain, while a war hero, is also a man who represents to many Americans the new soft values.
Merkel had a difficult time in the run-up to her recent party conference, because Jürgen Rüttgers, the minister-president of the largest German state, North-Rhine Westphalia, reminded the Christian Democrats of their historical support for strong social-welfare policies.
Only Royal may be said to represent softer lines against the hard-liner of the governing party, Nicolas Sarkozy.
So, have women at or near the top made no real difference to politics?
Whatever change they have brought has not been obvious.
In a sense, women’s advance is simply the normal consequence of the gradual move to effective equality of opportunity that began in the 1960’s.
It took decades to become real, and there are still countries that have a long way to go.
Despite Tymoshenko’s leading role in Ukraine, it would be surprising to see Russian President Vladimir Putin replaced by a woman, and, while there is a female vice-president in China, there is no sign of a woman becoming Japanese prime minister soon.
Even so, in many parts of the world, women have made considerable headway on the path to the top.
Not infrequently this has been helped by explicit policies.
David Cameron prides himself on a successful campaign to make 40% of all Conservative parliamentary candidates in Britain are women.
But this is precisely the point.
It is not the women at the top who have changed the scene.
Rather, it is a more general trend, helped along by open-minded leaders of both sexes, that has changed the political climate in countries.
No one, man or woman, can today aspire to setting the tone of public discourse without recognizing that politics is no longer only a man’s game.
In other words, normalization by equal opportunity is itself the change.
Whatever the particular values of leading candidates, this is undoubtedly progress.

What Boosts Gender Equality in Developing Countries?
WASHINGTON, DC – On March 8, the world will celebrate International Women’s Day, an annual opportunity to recommit to gender equality.
This year’s observance comes at an important time for women’s rights, as global movements like #MeToo and #TimesUp are refocusing attention on the discriminatory practices that women confront in their social and professional lives.
But while women in the developed world are waging big battles over gender bias, women and girls in developing countries remain focused on smaller victories.
On this International Women’s Day, we must not forget that in the world’s poorest communities, poverty, hunger, domestic violence, and discrimination remain endemic obstacles to gender parity.
I have studied gender and development in the Global South for 15 years.
My research, which has included thousands of interviews with women from India to Burkina Faso, has centered on one question: How can the international community improve the welfare of the world’s poorest women?
The answer, it turns out, is to help them do what they are already doing on their own.
One of the most effective ways to empower women anywhere, but especially in the developing world, is by promoting financial independence.
In many areas, that means supporting “informal savings groups,” networks of like-minded women who pay dues to build a shared pool of resources.
This money can then be drawn on to fund any number of items, such as small business expenses, school fees, or health-care costs.
Community-based savings groups – there are millions in Asia and Africa alone – are changing lives every day.
I once met a woman in Burkina Faso whose son owes his life to the financial resources of a savings network.
One evening, when the boy was violently ill with diarrhea, his mother called a taxi to take him to the nearest clinic.
But taxis, like ambulances, must be paid for in advance, and the woman had no money.
Fortunately, a neighbor who belonged to a health savings group was able to contribute and pay the fare.
That immediate access to cash very likely saved the boy’s life.
Most savings group loans are similarly small.
In Benin, for example, the average loan size in one group is just $9.
But, in a country where the average annual income is less than $800, small amounts can make a huge difference.
Unfortunately, many savings groups, as important as they are, do not scale; most operate in isolation from official services, which weakens their effectiveness.
Women in poor communities must rely on one another, but they also need access to government and international agencies if they are ever to escape from hunger and poverty.
That is why my organization, the Grameen Foundation, is using digital technology and mobile phones to connect savings groups with other service providers.
One of our largest projects is in Burkina Faso, a desperately poor country in West Africa where an estimated 55% of the population is food insecure for at least a portion of the year.
Since 1993, we have worked with more than 73,000 women in nearly 3,300 savings groups, bringing services directly to the women who need them.
Our average participant is 40 years old, illiterate, and earns just $7 a week selling crops like sesame and peanut.
When we began the program, only about half of the women we worked with said they felt empowered in their homes; many feared their husbands.
Today, those sentiments are slowly changing.
By serving as a bridge between informal savings groups and banks, health centers, schools, and agricultural extension services, we are helping women make better decisions about food use, nutritional practices, and spending.
Our goal is to reduce poverty rates by strengthening asset-management skills, which would give women a greater voice in their communities.
“Gender dialogue sessions” that we host are also strengthening family bonds.
During each of my field visits, I have been amazed at how these efforts are affecting women’s lives.
On one recent trip, I met Rasmata, a young mother who told me that thanks to the safety net of her savings group, she was managing to support her family despite her husband’s emigration abroad, her father’s recent death, and a lingering drought.
She was diversifying her income, managing her finances, and even adopting climate-smart farming techniques.
The best part was that she described herself as a “hard-working, respectful, rigorous, and ambitious woman.”
Those are adjectives that women everywhere, regardless of their financial situation or education, deserve to ascribe to themselves.
So this week, as the world celebrates the incredible progress that women have made on the long march to parity, I will be thinking about women like Rasmata, who have accomplished so much despite having so little.

Making “Women’s Work” Count
ISTANBUL – Over the next few months, the 12,000 employees based at Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, California will complete their move to an extravagant new campus.
The “spaceship,” covering 2.8 million square feet, includes a two-story yoga studio, running paths, and even revolutionary pizza boxes that keep slices crisp.
One thing it does not have, however, is daycare.
When it comes to ignoring the importance of childcare for working parents, Apple is far from unique.
And that omission places a powerful drag on parents’ ability to achieve their economic potential, with women suffering the most.
Worldwide, women carry out twice as much unpaid domestic and care work – including raising children, caring for sick or elderly family members, and managing the household – as men do.
In Mexico, India, and Turkey, women do three times more care work than men.
This “gender chore gap” limits women’s choices, as it impedes their ability to obtain formal education, secure good jobs, and achieve equal pay.
Indeed, though women around the world actually work more than men in total (including both paid and unpaid work), they earn one quarter less, on average, hold only one quarter of executive positions in the private sector, and occupy less than one quarter of all seats in national parliaments.
Only half of working-age women worldwide are in the paid labor force, compared to more than three quarters of men.
This situation is slowly beginning to change.
Unpaid household and care work is gradually shedding its reputation as “women’s work,” and men today are assuming more household responsibilities than their fathers and grandfathers did.
Some countries, particularly in Europe, are revising traditional leave policies so that parents can choose how to allocate time off after the birth of a child.
More broadly, the value of unpaid household and care work – not just for children and family members, but also for the long-term health of societies and economies – is increasingly being recognized.
Efforts to measure the contribution of care work to national economies have produced estimates ranging from 20% to 60% of GDP.
In 2015, United Nations member states adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which call for recognizing, reducing, and redistributing unpaid care work – a measure long proposed by feminist economists and gender-equality advocates.
The question now is what can actually be done to meet this objective.
The responsibility will lie, first and foremost, with governments.
After all, while businesses or neighborhood associations may offer childcare options to working parents, costs and quality vary widely.
Government action is needed to ensure that care services cover all who need them – from preschool children to the sick, the disabled, and the elderly – and that they are universally accessible and affordable.
Beyond services, however, achieving the SDGs’ targets will require policy change.
Most important, governments must establish requirements for parental and family leave programs. Together with private companies, they can also provide monetary incentives for men and women to share household and care work more equally.
Such policies have proved effective not only in Northern Europe – the most commonly cited model – but also in Eastern European countries like Lithuania, Estonia, and even Hungary, demonstrating that they can be applied anywhere.
At a time when many governments, particularly in the developing world, are faced with severe fiscal constraints, such interventions may seem farfetched.
But spending on the care sector should be viewed as an investment, not a cost.
A recent study in Turkey showed that one dollar of public money invested in the care sector could create 2.5 times as many jobs as a dollar invested in the construction industry.
More than half of those jobs – decent jobs that could raise incomes and living standards, particularly for poor households – would go to women.
International institutions can play an important role in helping governments to seize the opportunities presented by investment in the care sector.
In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the United Nations Development Programme undertook an initiative that helped women who had mostly worked at home their entire lives to find jobs in the care sector, enabling them to make use of their skills, by caring for children and for young adults with disabilities, while earning an income.
As populations grow and age, the care sector will only increase in importance.
Adapting to these new circumstances now will give countries a considerable advantage, as it bolsters women’s rights and freedoms, generates jobs, and make societies more equal.
So what are we waiting for?

Workers’ Paradise?
CAMBRIDGE -- Will the political resurgence of labor unions throw a wrench into the wheels of globalization?
Or will their growing strength serve to make globalization more sustainable by fostering great equality and fairness?
One way or the other, unions stand as a major wild card for the evolution of our economic system in 2008 and beyond.
Unions’ rising influence is evident in many recent events: German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s controversial deal to raise minimum wages for postal employees; several American presidential candidates’ open misgivings about trade and immigration; and the Chinese leadership’s nascent concerns about labor standards.
Along with their political clout, unions’ intellectual respectability is also experiencing a renaissance.
After decades of vilification by economists for raising unemployment and strangling growth, the union movement is now receiving backing from thought leaders such as Paul Krugman, who argues that stronger unions are needed to counter globalization’s worst excesses.
The sudden emergence of unions as a political force is particularly surprising in the United States, where private-sector union membership has fallen from 25% in 1975 to 8% today.
From high-tech Google to mass retailer Wal-Mart, US companies have found ways to keep their shops union-free.
Only the public sector, where the membership rate is 35%, has remained a union bastion.
One of my best friends from childhood married a union organizer who found it so difficult to land a job in the US that he eventually moved his family to strike-happy Canada.
Today, US political leaders such as Congressman Barney Frank want to bring back unions.
But there is good reason to be skeptical.
For a relatively poor country like China, real unions could help balance employers’ power, bringing quality-of-life benefits that outweigh the growth costs.
Factory conditions in parts of China are all too reminiscent of the early twentieth-century, pre-union US.
Thousands of Chinese workers die each year in coal mines that sometimes lack basic safety precautions.
But, for the US and rich countries in Europe, the argument that stronger unions would bring more benefits than costs is far more dubious.
Nowadays, most workers already have legal and statutory rights that cover the basic protections that unions originally fought for a century ago.
Instead, union influence today all too often serves to promulgate inflexible work practices and flat salary structures that do not adequately reward work effort and skill.
It is no surprise that the public sector, where productivity is low and fiscal constraints soft, typically has the greatest union concentration.
Teachers’ unions, especially, are a catastrophe, blocking any rationalization or improvement of many countries’ education systems.
Before the modern globalization era, unions could thrive by organizing on a national scale, giving them enormous bargaining power vis-à-vis both employers and consumers.
Now, after the explosive post-war expansion of global trade, most unions have seen their monopoly power eroded, if not shattered.
That is why unions throughout much of the developed world have been fighting so hard to block free-trade negotiations that might erode their position further.
Some of the issues that unions are promoting, such as human rights and environmental quality, are unassailable.
When they try to connect these issues with trade, however, their motives become questionable.
A case in point is union lobbying against the US-Colombia free-trade agreement, ratification of which would greatly advance US-Latin American relations.
Legitimate questions about how the Colombian government conducted its epic civil war with drug-financed rebels do not trump broader issues.
So anti-pact activists have complained that Colombia is anti-union because it does not protect union members from rebel violence.
Yet the Colombian government notes that all Colombians suffer from rebel violence – union members actually experience less of it than the rest of the population.
Unfortunately, this play is being re-enacted across a host of trade issues, including many involving China.
For rich countries, income redistribution is much better handled through taxes and benefits system, rather than by government edicts to strengthen unions.
The rich today pay so little in taxes in many countries, that it would be a big improvement simply to move to a flat tax, with a very high exemption level so that lower-income families pay nothing.
For middle-income countries, it is a tougher call.
But here, too, increasing workers’ legal and statutory rights, while allowing most unions to fade away, seems like the right approach.
Unfortunately, we are far more likely to see unions’ growing political influence become a major destabilizing force in trade and growth, with highly uncertain consequences.
When we see political leaders in many rich countries pander to unions by bashing each other on free trade and immigration, there is every reason to worry about trouble ahead.
That is why unions will be one of the main economic wild cards in 2008.

The Evolution of Work
CAMBRIDGE – In mid-December, the United Nations will launch the latest of its annual landmark Human Development Reports.
This year’s report focuses on the nature of work: how the way we earn a living is being transformed by economic globalization, new technologies, and innovations in social organization.
The outlook for developing countries, in particular, is decidedly mixed.
For most people most of the time, work is mostly unpleasant.
Historically, doing lots of backbreaking work is how countries have become rich.
And being rich is how some people get the chance to do more pleasant work.
Thanks to the Industrial Revolution, new technologies in cotton textiles, iron and steel, and transportation delivered steadily rising levels of labor productivity for the first time in history.
First in Britain in the mid-eighteenth century, and then in Western Europe and North America, men and women flocked from the countryside to towns to satisfy factories’ growing demand for labor.
But, for decades, workers gained few of the benefits of rising productivity.
They worked long hours in stifling conditions, lived in overcrowded and unsanitary housing, and experienced little growth in earnings.
Some indicators, such as workers’ average height, suggest that standards of living may have even declined for a while.
Eventually, capitalism transformed itself and its gains began to be shared more widely.
This was partly because wages naturally began to rise as the surplus of rural workers dried up.
But, equally important, workers organized themselves to defend their interests. Fearing revolution, the industrialists compromised.
Civil and political rights were extended to the working class.
Democracy, in turn, tamed capitalism further.
Employment conditions improved as state-mandated or negotiated arrangements led to reduced working hours, greater safety, and family, health, and other benefits.
Public investment in education and training made workers both more productive and freer to exercise choice.
As a result, labor’s share of the enterprise surplus rose.
While factory jobs never became pleasant, blue-collar occupations now enabled a middle-class standard of living, with all its consumption possibilities and lifestyle opportunities.
Eventually, technological progress undermined industrial capitalism.
Labor productivity in manufacturing industries rose much faster than in the rest of the economy: The same or higher quantity of steel, cars, and electronics could be produced with far fewer workers.
So the “excess” workers moved to service industries – education, health, finance, entertainment, and public administration, for example.
Thus was born the post-industrial economy.
Work became more pleasant for some, but not for all.
For those with the skills, capital, and savvy to prosper in the post-industrial age, services offered inordinate opportunities.
Bankers, consultants, and engineers earned much higher wages than their industrial-age forebears.
Equally important, office work allowed a degree of freedom and personal autonomy that factory work never provided.
Notwithstanding long hours (perhaps longer than in factory jobs), service professionals enjoyed much greater control over their daily lives and workplace decisions.
Teachers, nurses, and waiters were not paid nearly as well, but they, too, were released from the humdrum mechanical drudgery of the shop floor.
For less skilled workers, however, service-sector jobs meant giving up the negotiated benefits of industrial capitalism.
The transition to a service economy often went hand in hand with the decline of unions, employment protections, and norms of pay equity, greatly weakening workers’ bargaining power and job security.
So the post-industrial economy opened up a new chasm in the labor market, between those with stable, high-paid, and fulfilling services jobs and those with fleeting, low-paid, and unsatisfying jobs.
Two factors determined the share of each type of job – and thus the extent of inequality produced by the post-industrial transition: the education and skill level of the workforce, and the degree of institutionalization of labor markets in services (in addition to manufacturing).
Inequality, exclusion, and duality became more marked in countries where skills were poorly distributed and many services approximated the textbook “ideal” of spot markets.
The United States, where many workers are forced to hold multiple jobs in order to make an adequate living, remains the canonical example of this model.
The vast majority of workers still live in low- and middle-income countries and have yet to go through these transformations.
There are two reasons to believe that their future path will (or need) not unfold in quite the same way.
First, there is no reason that safe working conditions, freedom of association, and collective bargaining cannot be introduced at earlier stages of development than has occurred historically.
Just as political democracy need not wait for incomes to rise, strong labor standards need not lag behind economic development.
Workers in low-income countries should not be deprived of fundamental rights for the sake of industrial development and export performance.
Second, the forces of globalization and technological progress have combined to alter the nature of manufacturing work in a way that makes it very difficult, if not impossible, for newcomers to emulate the industrialization experience of the Four Asian Tigers, or the European and North American economies before them.
Many (if not most) developing countries are becoming service economies without having developed a large manufacturing sector – a process I have called “premature de-industrialization.”
Could premature de-industrialization be a blessing in disguise, enabling workers in the developing world to bypass the drudgery of manufacturing?
If so, how such a future could be constructed is not at all clear.
A society in which most workers are self-proprietors – shopkeepers, independent professionals, or artists – and set their own terms of employment while making an adequate living is feasible only when economy-wide productivity is already very high.
High-productivity services – such as IT or finance – require well-trained workers, not the unskilled kind that poor countries have in abundance.
So there is both good and bad news for the future of work in developing countries.
Thanks to social policy and labor rights, workers can become full stakeholders in the economy much earlier in the process of development.
At the same time, the traditional engine of economic development – industrialization – is likely to operate at much lower capacity.
The resulting combination of high public expectations and low income-producing capacity will be a major challenge for developing economies everywhere.

The Unfinished Business of Gender Parity
DAVOS – When it comes to the importance of gender equality in the workplace, the message has clearly gotten through to those at the top.
Surveys – including those conducted by my own organization – consistently show that business leaders understand the need for equal treatment of men and women in the workforce.
Indeed, my own conversations with senior businesspeople around the world confirm that progress clearly is being made.
The vast majority recognize the issue as imperative to their companies’ success and have implemented measures to promote gender parity in their organizations.
And yet, for all the fine words, much more remains to be done before gender parity is actually achieved.
The facts speak for themselves.
There is still a pay gap in every country in the world, with men earning more than women for similar jobs.
Likewise, the percentage of seats on corporate boards occupied by women appears to have stalled at just over 17%.
This bias has not gone unnoticed – especially among female employees.
In a 2015 PwC global survey of female millennials born between 1980 and 1995, half of those working in financial services said they believed that men received more favorable treatment when it came to promotions.
More than 70% said that as much as their organizations talk about diversity, in reality, opportunities remain unequal.
Interestingly, other studies conclude that when women are provided with the opportunity to perform on an equal footing with men, they more often than not come out on top.
A recent ten-year analysis of 300 start-up investments backed by venture capitalists in the United States showed that companies with a female founder performed 63% better than those with all-male founding teams.
And another of PwC’s research programs, examining the changing faces of billionaires worldwide, discovered what we called the “Athena Factor.”
The increase in the number of female billionaires significantly outpaces that among men, with Asia registering the fastest growth in the ranks of self-made female billionaires.
Where women have the opportunity to capitalize on their talents, they are doing so successfully and with gusto.
Meanwhile, there is growing recognition of the positive contribution that greater workforce diversity makes to business performance.
And yet, as reflected in the stubborn persistence of the pay gap, barriers to women’s progress remain.
What is now needed is a genuine and permanent shift in attitudes and behavior.
Many of the biases holding women back are unconscious; and, by their very nature, these blind spots cannot be tackled by statements of intent alone.
Tackling gender inequality will require us to identify where, how, and why these biases materialize, and to develop systematic strategies and interventions to root them out.
In order to accomplish this, businesses must actively challenge men to help advance women in the workforce.
That is why I am proud to be a founding Corporate Impact Champion of the UN Women’s HeForShe movement.
Creating real and lasting change will require helping men and women work together.
The business case for doing so is incontrovertible.
Not only do women make up half the global population; the same skills needed to work through differences in gender – open-mindedness, humility, empathy – can be used to work across other types of differences, be they cultural, physical, or personal.
It is important, of course, to reassure male skeptics who view gender parity as a threat.
In June 2015, I hosted a HeForShe chat on Twitter , and while the conversation was overwhelmingly positive, an obvious concern surfaced: Why should men help promote women to positions for which they themselves are aiming?
Addressing such concerns will require us to show that we are not promoting some people at the expense of others; gender parity must be win-win, not zero-sum.
At PwC, this is being addressed by hosting conversations in which men and women discuss gender issues collaboratively and respectfully, and by working with both genders to challenge double standards and acknowledge potential blind spots.
Recent research suggests that, at the current rate of progress, it will take another 80 years to reach gender parity.
That is not good enough. Let us all commit to achieving it in our lifetimes – for the benefit of everyone.

Four Ways to Beat HIV/AIDS
PITTSBURGH – In the fight against HIV/AIDS, some stories illuminate the long road to global eradication more than others.
In 2009, I heard one such story in Tanzania.
I was visiting a remote village when I spoke to a woman who knew that she was HIV-positive.
She told me that the established health guidelines at the time indicated that she could not receive treatment until her count of CD4 T-helper cells, a type of white blood cell used by the immune system, had dropped below a certain threshold.
After walking several miles to get her count checked, she arrived at the clinic only to find its testing machine broken.
The machine was still inoperative the second time she made the long journey.
Only months later, after her third trip to the clinic on foot, did she receive her cell count: her levels were far below the necessary threshold.
Her treatment should have begun months before.
Since HIV/AIDS was first identified in 1984, it has killed more than 35 million people.
Although the number of AIDS-related deaths has fallen by almost half since peaking in 2005, there are still far too many people dying from this preventable condition.
In 2016 alone, one million people around the world died from HIV-related causes, while 1.8 million more became infected.
Contrary to popular myth, we have not turned the corner on AIDS – not by a long shot.
World AIDS Day, on December 1, is an occasion to honor the millions of victims, and to recommit to ending this devastating disease.
According to UNAIDS, just 54% of HIV-positive adults, and only 43% of HIV-positive children, are currently receiving the antiretroviral therapies that save lives and prevent new infections.
With so many untreated patients, the virus will continue to spread.
As CEO of a global pharmaceutical company, I’m proud of the work we have done to fight HIV/AIDS around the world.
Today, more than eight million people – nearly half of all patients receiving treatment for HIV in developing countries – depend on the antiretroviral treatments that we produce.
But for those of us on the front lines of this struggle, our work is far from over.
The pharmaceutical industry has a responsibility to expand access to testing and treatment, and to help stop the spread of HIV once and for all.
Fulfilling four key commitments will make this goal achievable.
For starters, pharmaceutical companies should do more to increase the availability of low-cost, generic medicines.
My company, Mylan, introduced the first generic once-daily pill for developing countries in 2009, and we have continually reduced its price to make it more accessible to more people.
With this treatment alone, Mylan and other generic manufacturers save the US government, international donors, and national health programs more than $4.5 billion a year.
Still, treatment options could be expanded further.
In September, Mylan announced a collaboration with UNAIDS, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, and other partners to provide the next-generation single-pill HIV regimen to patients in more than 90 low- and middle-income countries for less than $75 per year.
These drugs are widely used in high-income countries because they produce fewer side effects.
Affordability initiatives like this one should be replicated.
Next, drug makers must continue investing in capacity and supply-chain reliability.
Since 2005, the number of people on antiretroviral therapies worldwide has grown by a factor of ten, to 21 million.
But roughly twice as many people are currently infected with HIV.
Over the last decade, Mylan has invested more than $250 million in expanding production capacity, and we now produce four billion tablets and capsules each year.
But further investments are needed if we are to provide access to the other 21 million people still not on treatment.
A third urgently needed commitment is to increase support for research that accelerates the development of new innovations in effective and efficient treatment delivery.
For example, Mylan provides study medications to research trials, like the MaxART trial in Swaziland, which demonstrated that providing treatment to all HIV-positive people is the best way to slow the disease’s spread.
We also supported the Kirby Institute’s ENCORE1 trial, to develop a reduced-dose version of the most commonly used HIV treatment regimen.
And we are currently working with the US Agency for International Development as part of a partnership called OPTIMIZE, which aims to accelerate access to new therapies.
We do not support trials like these because we hope to gain any marketable intellectual property – we won’t. Rather, we support them because it is the right way to advance science and improve treatment.
Finally, real gains in the fight against HIV/AIDS will require drug makers to account for the limitations of health-care systems and distribution networks in the developing countries they serve.
Antiretroviral therapies for children are a good example of these challenges.
Drugs for young people produced in the West are often liquids that require refrigeration. But developing countries often have limited cold-storage capacities or an inability to transport liquid in bulk.
That’s why Mylan has developed heat-stable, taste-masked, dispersible tablets that can easily be incorporated into food.
Our scientists are now working on the next-generation formula, which comes in the equivalent of a sugar packet that even newborns can take.
More innovations like these will be needed to solve the country-specific issues that patients face.
The global health community has made remarkable progress in turning the tide on HIV/AIDS, introducing new products and advocating for earlier treatment.
But when I think back to the woman I met in Tanzania, I am reminded of how much work remains to be done.
Makers of generic medicines have an important role to play in this fight, and we will not stop working until treatment is available to every patient in the world who needs it.

The World Bank Needs to Return to Its Mission
NEW YORK – The World Bank declares that its mission is to end extreme poverty within a generation and to boost shared prosperity.
These goals are universally agreed as part of the Sustainable Development Goals. But the World Bank lacks an SDG strategy, and now it is turning to Wall Street to please its political masters in Washington.
The Bank’s president, Jim Yong Kim, should find a better way forward, and he can do so by revisiting one of his own great successes.
Kim and I worked closely together from 2000 to 2005, to scale up the world’s response to the AIDS epidemic.
Partners in Health, the NGO led by Kim and his colleague, Harvard University’s Paul Farmer, had used antiretroviral medicines (ARVs) to treat around 1,000 impoverished HIV-infected rural residents in Haiti, and had restored them to health and hope.
I pointed out to Kim and Farmer 18 years ago that their success in Haiti could be expanded to reach millions of people at low cost and with very high social benefits.
I recommended a new multilateral funding mechanism, a global fund, to fight AIDS, and a new funding effort by the United States.
In early 2001, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan launched the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, and in 2003 US President George W. Bush launched the PEPFAR program.
The World Health Organization, led by the Director-General Gro Harlem Brundtland, recruited Kim to lead the WHO’s scale-up effort.
Kim did a fantastic job, and his efforts provided the groundwork for bringing ARVs to millions, saving lives, livelihoods, and families.
There are four lessons of that great success.
First, the private sector was an important partner, by offering patent-protected drugs at production cost.
Drug companies eschewed profits in the poorest countries out of decency and for the sake of their reputations.
They recognized that patent rights, if exercised to excess, would be a death warrant for millions of poor people.
Second, the effort was supported by private philanthropy, led by Bill Gates, who inspired others to contribute as well.
The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation backed the new Global Fund, the WHO, and the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, which I led for the WHO in 2000-2001 (and which successfully campaigned for increased donor funding to fight AIDS and other killer diseases).
Third, the funding to fight AIDS took the form of outright grants, not Wall Street loans.
Fighting AIDS in poor countries was not viewed as a revenue-generating investment needing fancy financial engineering.
It was regarded as a vital public good that required philanthropists and high-income countries to fund life-saving treatment for poor and dying people.
Fourth, trained public health specialists led the entire effort, with Kim and Farmer serving as models of professionalism and rectitude.
The Global Fund does not stuff the pockets of corrupt ministers, or trade funding for oil concessions or arms deals.
The Global Fund applies rigorous, technical standards of public health, and holds recipient countries accountable – including through transparency and co-financing requirements – for delivering services.
The World Bank needs to return to its mission.
The SDGs call for, among other things, ending extreme poverty and hunger, instituting universal health coverage, and universal primary and upper secondary education by 2030.
But, despite making only slow progress toward these goals, the Bank shows no alarm or strategy to help get the SDGs on track for 2030.
On the contrary, rather than embrace the SDGs, the Bank is practically mute, and its officials have even been heard to mutter negatively about them in the corridors of power.
Perhaps US President Donald Trump doesn’t want to hear about his government’s responsibilities vis-à-vis the SDGs.
But it is Kim’s job to remind him and the US Congress of those obligations – and that it was a Republican president, George W. Bush who creatively and successfully pursued the battle against AIDS.
Wall Street may help to structure the financing of large-scale renewable energy projects, public transport, highways, and other infrastructure that can pay its way with tolls and user fees.
A World Bank-Wall Street partnership could help to ensure that such projects are environmentally sound and fair to the affected communities.
That would be all for the good.
Yet such projects, designed for profit or at least direct cost recovery, are not even remotely sufficient to end extreme poverty.
Poor countries need grants, not loans, for basic needs like health and education.
Kim should draw on his experience as the global health champion who successfully battled against AIDS, rather than embracing an approach that would only bury poor countries in debt.
We need the World Bank’s voice and strenuous efforts to mobilize grant financing for the SDGs.
Health care for the poor requires systematic training and deployment of community health workers, diagnostics, medicines, and information systems.
Education for the poor requires trained teachers, safe and modern classrooms, and connectivity to other schools and to online curricula.
These SDGs can be achieved, but only if there is a clear strategy, grant financing, and clear delivery mechanisms.
The World Bank should develop the expertise to help donors and recipient governments make these programs work.
Kim knows just how to do this, from his own experience.
Trump and other world leaders are personally accountable for the SDGs.
They need to do vastly more. So, too, do the world’s super-rich, whose degree of wealth is historically unprecedented.
The super-rich have received round after round of tax cuts and special tax breaks, easy credits from central banks, and exceptional gains from technologies that are boosting profits while lowering unskilled workers’ wages.
Even with stock markets’ recent softness, the world’s 2000+ billionaires have around $10 trillion in wealth – enough to fund fully the incremental effort needed to end extreme poverty, if the governments also do their part.
When going to Wall Street, or Davos, or other centers of wealth, the World Bank should inspire the billionaires to put their surging wealth into personal philanthropy to support the SDGs.
Bill Gates is doing this, with historic results, for public health.
Which billionaires will champion the SDGs for education, renewable energy, fresh water and sanitation, and sustainable agriculture?
With a clear SDG plan, the World Bank would find partners to help it fulfill its core, historic, and vital mission.

Doing Business Should Stop Promoting Tax Competition
NEW YORK – The World Bank Group has just released Doing Business 2017: Equal Opportunity for All, the latest version of its flagship report.
According to the Bank, the annual report is one of the world’s most influential policy publications, as it encourages countries to reduce the regulatory burden on the private sector.
But there is a serious flaw in the report’s formula: the way it treats corporate taxation.
Doing Business reports rate 11 areas of business regulation in 190 countries, using data on compliance burdens collected by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC).
The Bank then formulates an overall score that supposedly reflects the ease of conducting commercial activities, and ranks countries according to that score.
The lower the regulatory burden on businesses, the higher a country ranks.
The problem is that “regulatory burden,” according to Doing Business, includes the collection of taxes that are necessary to fund public infrastructure and basic social services – both of which are critical to enhance growth and employment.
Even the report recognizes that, for most economies, taxes are the main source of the government revenues needed to fund “projects related to health care, education, public transport, and unemployment benefits, among others.”
Beyond promoting budget-straining tax competition among countries, Doing Business exaggerates the tax burden on companies.
For one thing, it considers all the kinds of taxes firms might pay – not just corporate income tax.
Specifically, the report’s estimates for “total tax rate as a proportion of profits” include taxes for employees’ health insurance and pensions; property and property transfers; dividends, capital gains, and financial transactions; and public services like waste collection and infrastructure.
Those are taxes that should be categorized as social contributions or service charges.
Augmenting estimates further, Doing Business does not measure only expected tax payments.
It considers the cost (in staff time) of activities like filing returns, making claims, and, beginning this year, post-filing processes, to be part of the tax burden on businesses.
In reality, corporate-tax payments, as a share of gross profits, are quite low.
According to Doing Business’ own data, the world average amounts to just 16%, with the European Union coming in at 13%, the United States at 19%, and Latin America, Asia, and Africa at 16%.
But even those figures are probably too high, because of another reality that Doing Business overlooks: tax avoidance and evasion.
Whatever a country’s official corporate-tax rate might be, the reality is that few companies actually pay the full amount.
Indeed, while a small manufacturer for the domestic market might adhere to the official rate, the large domestic and multinational firms that account for most production and exports worldwide are well-positioned to take advantage of tax avoidance schemes.
And they typically do not hesitate to do so.
The OECD has estimated that tax avoidance by multinationals averages $200 billion per year – a figure that far exceeds total international development assistance.
PwC itself is in a good position to enlighten the Bank on this issue.
As the famous “LuxLeaks” of 2014 revealed, from 2002 to 2010, the firm assisted its multinational clients in obtaining at least 548 tax rulings in Luxembourg, enabling them to avoid corporate income tax globally.
All of this places smaller local firms at a substantial competitive disadvantage.
This may sound like an argument for overhauling Doing Business’ “paying taxes” indicator.
But what is really needed is for Doing Business to drop that indicator altogether, because the assumption underpinning it – that low corporate taxation promotes growth – does not withstand scrutiny.
Research conducted by the International Monetary Fund and others indicates that tax competition does not promote productive investment worldwide.
In assuming the opposite, Doing Business becomes riddled with contradictions.
It recognizes that “higher income inequality is associated with a smaller tax base and therefore lower tax collection.”
Yet it advocates giving corporations a respite from taxes, thereby undermining tax collection in a way that, by potentially promoting inequality, could intensify that impact.
The report praises countries like the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Peru, Portugal, Senegal, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan for reducing their corporate-tax rates, while scolding Greece for increasing it – ignoring the need for government revenues and public investment in those countries.
It also supports reduced labor protection and overlooks environmental externalities – stances that controvert the Bank’s own commitments.
This year’s Doing Business report made some positive changes, adding indicators for women in business and public procurement.
But, when it comes to the paying taxes indicator, the report has things all wrong.
Indeed, it runs counter to the global consensus on the need for effective international cooperation to ensure equitable collection of tax revenues, including measures to limit tax avoidance by multinationals and other private firms.
A race to the bottom in corporate taxation will only hurt poor people and poor countries.
If Doing Business is to live up to its own slogan, “equal opportunity for all,” it should abandon the tax indicator altogether.

The Risk of a New Economic Non-Order
LONDON – Next month, when finance ministers and central bank governors from more than 180 countries gather in Washington, DC, for the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, they will confront a global economic order under increasing strain.
Having failed to deliver the inclusive economic prosperity of which it is capable, that order is subject to growing doubts – and mounting challenges.
Barring a course correction, the risks that today’s order will yield to a world economic non-order will only intensify.
The current international economic order, spearheaded by the United States and its allies in the wake of World War II, is underpinned by multilateral institutions, including the IMF and the World Bank.
These institutions were designed to crystallize member countries’ obligations, and they embodied a set of best economic-policy practices that evolved into what became known as the “Washington Consensus.”
That consensus was rooted in an economic paradigm that aimed to promote win-win interactions among countries, emphasizing trade liberalization, relatively unrestricted cross-border capital flows, free-market pricing, and domestic deregulation.
All of this stood in stark contrast to what developed behind the Iron Curtain and in China over the first half of the postwar period.
For several decades, the Western-led international order functioned well, helping to deliver prosperity and relative financial stability.
Then it was shaken by a series of financial shocks that culminated in the 2008 global financial crisis, which triggered cascading economic failures that pushed the world to the edge of a devastating multi-year depression.
It was the most severe economic breakdown since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
But the crisis did not appear out of nowhere to challenge a healthy economic order.
On the contrary, the evolution of the global order had long been outpaced by structural economic changes on the ground, with multilateral governance institutions taking too long to recognize fully the significance of financial-sector developments and their impact on the real economy, or to make adequate room for emerging economies.
For example, governance structures, including voting power, correspond better to the economic realities of yesterday than to those of today and tomorrow.
And nationality, rather than merit, still is the dominant guide for the appointment of these institutions’ leaders, with top positions still reserved for European and US citizens.
The destabilizing consequences of this obstinate failure to reform sufficiently multilateral governance have been compounded by China’s own struggle to reconcile its domestic priorities with its global economic responsibilities as the world’s second-largest economy.
Several other countries, particularly among the advanced economies, have also failed to transform their domestic policies to account for changes to economic relationships resulting from globalization, liberalization, and deregulation.
As a result of all of this, the balance of winners and losers has become increasingly extreme and more difficult to manage, not just economically, but also politically and socially.
With too many people feeling marginalized, forgotten, and dispossessed – and angry at the leaders and institutions that have allowed this to happen – domestic policy pressure has intensified, causing countries to turn inward.
This tendency is reflected in recent challenges to several features of the economic order, such as the North American Free-Trade Agreement, as well as America’s withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the United Kingdom’s renunciation of European Union membership.
All are casting a shadow on the future of the global economic system.
America’s inward turn, already underway for several years, has been particularly consequential, because it leaves the world order without a main conductor.
With no other country or group of countries anywhere close to being in a position to carry the baton, the emergence of what the political scientist Ian Bremmer has called a “G-Zero era” becomes a lot more probable.
China is responding to the global system’s weakening core by accelerating its efforts to build small networks, including around the traditional Western-dominated power structures.
This has included the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the proliferation of bilateral payments agreements, and the pursuit of the “Belt and Road Initiative” to build infrastructure linking China with western Asia, Europe, and Africa.
These dynamics are stoking trade tensions and raising the risk of economic fragmentation.
If this trend continues, the global economic and financial configuration will become increasingly unstable, amplifying geopolitical and security threats at a time when better cross-border coordination is vital to address threats from non-state actors and disruptive regimes, such as North Korea.
Over time, the risks associated with this shift toward a global economic non-order could have severe adverse effects on geopolitics and national security.
None of this is new.
Yet, year after year, top government officials at the IMF/World Bank annual meetings fail to address it.
This year is likely to be no different.
Instead of discussing concrete steps to slow and reverse the march toward a global economic non-order, officials will probably welcome the cyclical uptick in global growth and urge member countries to do more to remove structural impediments to faster, more durable, and more inclusive growth.
While understandable, that isn’t good enough.
The upcoming meetings offer a critical opportunity to start a serious discussion of how to arrest the lose-lose dynamics that have been gaining traction in the global economy.
The longer it takes for the seeds of reform to be sown, the less likely they will be to take root – and the higher the probability that a lose-lose world economic non-order will emerge.

Poverty Beyond the Numbers
ASUNCIÓN – What is poverty?
For decades, we have defined it with a number, which the World Bank currently puts at a personal income of less than $1.90 per day.
But a single number fails to capture the complexity of poverty.
Measuring more than just income is essential to understanding the needs of poor people and delivering optimal assistance.
As the World Bank convenes its Spring Meetings in Washington, DC next week, we have an opportunity to set benchmarks that include social and environmental dimensions of poverty.
The Bank has acknowledged that more than income should be considered, and recently established a Commission on Global Poverty to recommend additional metrics.
Although many public and private groups already collect data on a range of issues affecting poor communities such as nutrition, maternal health, or access to education, such information remains largely untapped and is rarely shared across institutions.
But there are some beacons of light, including the Social Progress Index, which provides a framework for tracking multiple symptoms of poverty across countries and complements traditional income-based measures.
When we rely on a single number to measure poverty, we misdiagnose the needs of poor people.
In my home country, Paraguay, I work with one of the country’s largest social enterprises, Fundación Paraguaya, to provide microfinance, education, and training to thousands of our poorest citizens.
We look at 50 metrics across six dimensions of poverty, including income, housing, education, and infrastructure.
One of our clients, Doña Mercedes, is now a successful micro-entrepreneur from a rural community not far from the capital city of Asunción.
When she first started with Fundación Paraguaya, she was sharing a single-bedroom home with 16 other family members and cooking meals on a small fire pit on the dirt floor.
Now she has a cement floor, a brick house, a separate kitchen, and around $500 in personal savings.
By using Fundación Paraguaya’s self-evaluation on poverty, she was able to understand her own needs better and address them one at time.
While traditional approaches focus largely on estimating the sources of household expenses and income, the Fundación Paraguaya self-evaluation helped Doña Mercedes break down her needs into 50 discrete areas that she could work on, piece by piece, and monitor over time.
For example, she self-evaluated the state of her bathroom and kitchen, the quality of the food eaten at home, the family’s dental health, the number of separate bedrooms in the house, and even her self-esteem and decision-making capacity.
A simple poverty map helps her track her progress by using the colors of the stoplight, red, yellow, and green, and highlight her priority areas.
Next she plans to add two more bedrooms to her house and to work on enlarging her business.
Fundación Paraguaya has been able to replicate this type of success in other parts of the world.
In Tanzania, where I worked for three years in rural communities, we helped villages in the Southern Highlands adapt our poverty indicators to the local context in order to tackle water, sanitation, and electrification needs.
Similar efforts are being deployed in South Africa, Nigeria, Uganda, China, and beyond.
We could make even more progress with public-sector support.
Fundación Paraguaya collects rich data across multiple dimensions, tracking more than 8,700 families each year in Paraguay alone.
If this information were to reach the government of Paraguay – which has its own methods for collecting data – we could identify pockets of poverty sooner and customize programs to help each family.
Because the information is self-reported, this sort of collaboration could deliver targeted aid and highlight specific public services that are needed.
Moreover, if the World Bank’s Commission on Global Poverty adopts multidimensional poverty measures, it will spur other organizations to produce and share more detailed poverty data.
That will give aid workers a more comprehensive poverty map of the world, helping to boost the effectiveness of anti-poverty efforts everywhere.
It won’t be easy to choose which measures to include, or even how to set universal yardsticks; but even adopting a few basic ones would spur progress.
For too long, one-dimensional measures such as the $1.90 per day guideline have misdiagnosed poor people’s problems – and more importantly, their causes.
We know that the $1.90 per day benchmark does not fully capture the struggles of poor people in places such as Paraguay.
Fortunately, the World Bank now appears to recognize the limits of its income-based indicator.
Ensuring that the right type of aid reaches those most in need in a timely and effective manner requires development policymakers to embrace the type of multidimensional poverty data that aid organizations like Fundación Paraguaya have learned to gather.

The High Cost of “De-Risking” Infrastructure Finance
OTTAWA – The World Bank and other multilateral institutions are increasingly promoting measures to “de-risk” infrastructure investments in developing countries, in order to make such projects more attractive for international finance.
But “de-risking” is a misnomer: any project can be set back by external events, poor design, or mismanagement.
At least some level of risk – whether stemming from human error and institutional weakness, or from earthquakes, hurricanes, and countless other sources – is inherent in all infrastructure investments.
So the question is not how to eliminate risk, but rather how to allocate it between participating parties.
When the World Bank and others talk about de-risking infrastructure finance, they really mean reducing the risk for investors – and increasing the risk for governments.
The proposed risk-allocation provisions for public-private partnerships contained in the World Bank’s Guidance on PPP Contractual Provisions, 2017 Edition take this approach to a new extreme.
In almost any contingency – from “force majeure” to performance failures on the part of the private party – the public party is directed to assume all or a significant part of the risk.
Moreover, the Bank’s metric for determining the effectiveness of this unyielding approach is “successfully procured PPP transactions.”
Missing is any measure of whether a project is actually providing the intended goods or services to citizens, and any mechanism for recourse if it is not.
This extreme approach to risk allocation could have far-reaching consequences.
A major reason why governments use PPPs in infrastructure is so that they can list such projects as “off-book.” That means the financing of the project is neither counted as a direct government capital expense nor applied against government debt ceilings.
And because a project’s costs are supposed to be paid out over time through direct user fees or operational funds furnished by the government, the capital expenditure is regarded as “free money” that governments need not account for.
But financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund are now pushing back against this notion of “free money,” by pointing out that the higher the risk for a government, the less a project can be defined as “off-book.”
Accordingly, the World Bank’s lopsided risk-allocation provisions should actually make it more likely that PPP projects will have to be categorized as on-book financing and debt. That would be a good thing in itself.
By listing all infrastructure projects as on-book, governments will be in a better position to test whether they are delivering real value for money.
The problem is that these discussions are all happening behind the scenes.
In the meantime, the World Bank has continued to promote PPPs as the only acceptable form of infrastructure financing for developing countries in cases where a private party can do the job.
And governments have continued to accumulate ever more risk, on the assumption that it is off-book and thus not counted as a sovereign-debt obligation.
As a result, many developing countries are now heading for a doomsday scenario.
The risks that governments have taken on will last 20-30 years in many cases. During that time, governments will face severe challenges in managing public expenditures, and they will incur unforeseen costs related to off-book commitments and excessive debt, raising the possibility of a default on all credit commitments.
Making matters worse, the World Bank’s current approach creates moral hazard: the less risk the private party in a PPP assumes, the less it has to lose from poor performance.
The Bank’s guidance provisions stipulate that even a private-sector partner that has failed to deliver must be compensated in order for a government to terminate the contract.
As a result, some private-sector contractors may not assume that they have to perform well; instead, they may constantly weigh the costs and benefits of doing mediocre or poor-quality work.
The current approach is also an open invitation for private parties to squeeze governments even further, by renegotiating active contracts.
Faced with absorbing the full costs of a failed project or paying more to ensure that it succeeds, a government has little choice but to accede to a private-sector partner’s demands.
This is not a far-fetched risk.
The World Bank and others have understood for years that private companies frequently initiate contract renegotiations in PPP infrastructure projects.
And this is even more likely to happen when contracts are awarded in a context of imperfect competition, which creates opportunities for private companies to set unrealistic contract terms.
No doubt, the World Bank has good intentions.
But pushing all of the risk onto governments is not the way to attract investment in developing countries.
The Bank urgently needs to reverse course. That means promoting balanced risk allocations and ensuring that all infrastructure projects are assessed as if they were on-book.
Guidance that is blind to its own consequences is not helpful.
And when it is offered to developing countries that already have unsustainable sovereign debts, it is downright dangerous.

Can the World Bank Redeem Itself?
CAMBRIDGE – In recent years, as the World Bank’s financing role has been eclipsed by the rise of private capital and a surge in money from China, its leaders have been desperately seeking a new mission.
And interminable reorganizations, politicized appointments, and the changing priorities of successive presidents have contributed to the perception that the institution is less than functional.
But can that change?
The World Bank has tried to reinvent itself as a supplier of global public goods and a “knowledge bank” that provides data, analysis, and research to its developing-country clients.
And few would deny the Bank’s achievements when it comes to gathering indicators of economic activity, measuring poverty, identifying deficiencies in the provision of health and education, and, in earlier years, designing and evaluating development projects.
But many, such as the Nobel laureate economist Angus Deaton, have criticized the World Bank’s overall performance.
One problem is that development outcomes also depend on poor countries’ external economic environment, which is shaped by the policies of the major economies.
And when it comes to promoting sound policies, the World Bank has fallen far short in recent decades, exemplified by three major intellectual sins of omission.
The first relates to the World Bank’s role in the Latin American debt crisis of the early 1980s.
As its official history shows, the Bank restricted research on the implications of excessive borrowing during the crisis.
Moreover, it did little to make the case for debt write-downs, despite the reckless increase in lending by big banks.
Instead, through its structural-adjustment lending, the World Bank, along with the International Monetary Fund, effectively became a debt collector for creditors.
The result was a lost decade for Latin America, but not for the bankers.
The resulting moral hazard would encourage another bout of exuberant lending, which led to further financial crises in developing countries in the subsequent decade.
The World Bank was also silent when its developing-country clients’ access to life-saving medications was being restricted.
In the late 1980s, the leading industrialized countries – the United States, Europe, and Japan – began to push for stronger patent regimes that would boost their own pharmaceutical companies’ profits.
In 1995, developing countries were forced to sign the onerous Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights agreement at the World Trade Organization.
Moreover, under Section 301 of the US Trade Act of 1974, sanctions were imposed on several developing countries, from Chile to India, accused of failing to strengthen patent protections sufficiently.
Even when the AIDS crisis was ravaging Sub-Saharan Africa in the early 2000s, global patent rules were not just maintained, but actually tightened further, until pressure from civil society finally forced the expansion of access to affordable treatment.
The World Bank, however, said little.
This brings us to the World Bank’s third failure, the consequences of which are unfolding today.
During much of the 1980s and 1990s, the Bank oversaw structural adjustment programs in developing countries that focused on deregulation, privatization, and economic liberalization, especially trade opening, all of which helped to enable globalization.
While there were undoubtedly problems with many aspects of such a one-size-fit-all package of policies – the Washington Consensus, as it was known – the trade liberalization component helped accelerate lower-middle-income and middle-income countries’ economic convergence with developed countries.
But, today, the United States is rejecting trade openness, imposing unilateral tariffs and other barriers, and renegotiating trade deals on worse terms.
And the World Bank’s silence is deafening.
Its senior leadership has said nothing about the serious threat posed by the actions of the US or of other major players.
While the Bank’s annual report, released in September, talks of a commitment to “researching today’s most pressing topics,” trade is not among them.
This is not just some oversight; during all of these episodes, the Bank knew that its responsibility was to act as an advocate for its poor clients.
Instead, it decided – every time – to kowtow to its most powerful shareholders and their vested interests (such as Big Pharma and the financial industry), arguably in exchange for additional resources for its soft-loan window (the International Development Association) and, less frequently, capital increases for the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and International Finance Corporation.
For example, this April – after the US had launched its trade war with tariffs on steel and aluminum – the Development Committee of the World Bank Board of Governors endorsed a package that included a $7.5 billion paid-in capital increase for the IBRD.
This required the support of President Donald Trump’s administration, leading to silence from the Bank until June, when it finally warned of the negative impact of trade protectionism on global growth.
One might wonder whether such a Faustian bargain could be worthwhile if it means that the World Bank has more resources to promote development in poor countries.
But while money certainly matters, the evidence suggests that development outcomes are determined more by factors like state capacity and national policies, and crucially, a supportive global environment.
Rising trade protectionism, tighter immigration policies, and a lack of action on climate change by the world’s biggest economic players – particularly the US – thus pose serious threats to development, which a little extra money for the World Bank cannot offset.
The ends do not justify the means: money may not matter that much, while ideas matter immensely in the broader fight against poverty (as this year’s Nobel Economics laureate, Paul Romer, has shown).
The World Bank cannot erase its troubling history of silence.
But it may be able to redeem itself.
Its new chief economist is an expert on trade.
The Bank’s leadership should empower her to lead the charge in making the intellectual case for open markets for goods, services, and people.
The World Bank is well aware that its mission – “to reduce poverty, and improve living standards by promoting sustainable growth and investment in people” – cannot be achieved without an open global system.
If it chooses not to uphold a core tenet of its mission, and instead continues to try ingratiating itself with its largest shareholders, it will not only fail its clients throughout the developing world; it will also lose whatever is left of its raison d’être.

The Sky Is Not Falling
VIENNA – Humans are partial to bad news.
Media outlets reflect and shape this preference, feeding us woe and panic.
Long, slow, positive trends don’t make it to the front page or to water-cooler conversations.
So we develop peculiar misperceptions, especially the idea that a preponderance of things are going wrong.
When I published The Skeptical Environmentalist in 2001, I pointed out that the world was getting better in many respects.
Back then, this was viewed as heresy, as it punctured several common and cherished misperceptions, such as the idea that natural resources were running out, that an ever-growing population was leaving less to eat, and that air and water were becoming ever-more polluted.
In each case, careful examination of the data established that the gloomy scenarios prevailing at the time were exaggerated.
While fish stocks, for example, are depleted because of a lack of regulation, we can actually eat more fish than ever, thanks to the advent of aquaculture.
Worries that we are losing forests overlook the reality that as countries become richer, they increase their forest cover.
Since I wrote the book, the world has only become better, according to many important indicators.
We have continued to see meaningful reductions in infant mortality and malnutrition, and there have been massive strides toward eradication of polio, measles, malaria, and illiteracy.
By focusing on the most lethal environmental problem – air pollution – we can see some of the reasons for improvement.
As the world developed, deaths from air pollution have declined dramatically, and that trend is likely to continue.
Looking at a polluted city in a country like China might suggest otherwise, but the air inside the homes of most poor people is about ten times more polluted than the worst outdoor air in Beijing.
The most serious environmental problem for humans is indoor air pollution from cooking and heating with dirty fuels like wood and dung – which is the result of poverty.
In 1900, more than 90% of all air pollution deaths resulted from indoor air pollution.
Economic development has meant more outdoor pollution, but also much less indoor pollution.
Reductions in poverty have gone hand in hand with a four-fold reduction in global air pollution mortality. Yet more people today still die from indoor air pollution than from outdoor pollution.
Even in China, while outside air has become a lot more polluted, poverty reduction has caused a lower risk of total air pollution death.
And as countries become richer, they can afford to regulate and cut even outdoor air pollution.
Two hundred years ago, almost every person on the planet lived in poverty, and a tiny elite in luxury.
Today just 9.1% of the population, or almost 700 million people, lives on less than $1.90 per day (or what used to be one dollar in 1985).
And just in the last 20 years, the proportion of people living in extreme poverty has almost halved.
Yet few of us know this.
The Gapminder foundation surveyed the UK and found that just 10% of people believe poverty has decreased.
In South Africa and in Sweden, more people believe extreme poverty has doubled than believe – correctly – that it has plummeted.
How do we continue our swift progress?
There has been no shortage of well-intentioned policy interventions, so we have decades of data showing what works well and what doesn’t.
In the latter category, even well-considered ideas from the world’s most eminent thinkers can fall short.
The ambitious Millennium Villages concept was supposed to create simultaneous progress on multiple fronts, producing “major results in three or fewer years,” according to founder Jeffrey D. Sachs.
But a study by the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development shows the villages had “moderately positive impacts,” and “little overall impact on poverty.”
It’s more constructive to focus on what works.
Global analysis of development targets for Copenhagen Consensus by a panel of Nobel laureate economists showed where more money can achieve the most.
They concluded that improved access to contraception and family-planning services would reduce maternal and child mortality, and also – through a demographic dividend – increase economic growth.
Likewise, research assessing the best development policies for Haiti found that focusing on improvements in nutrition through the use of fortified flour would transform the health of young children, creating lifelong benefits.
Other Copenhagen Consensus research suggests that scaling up government e-procurement platforms would be transformative.
This may sound tangential to poverty reduction, but it’s not.
On average, developing countries use half their budgets on procurement; enabling transparent competition could reduce losses caused by corruption.
This is not mere speculation.
A case study in Bangladesh, which spends more than $9 billion on public procurement annually, found that piloting e-procurement in just one government department lowered prices by 12%, leaving more resources for other important budget priorities.
The research shows that expanding digital procurement government-wide would save $670 million annually – enough to increase annual public-health spending by about 50%.
The Bangladeshi government is now fast-tracking this expansion.
And the most powerful weapon in the fight against poverty is the one that got us where we are today: broad-based economic growth.
Over the past 30 years, China’s growth spurt alone lifted an unprecedented 680 million people above the poverty line.
A global trade agreement – such as a successful conclusion to the stalled Doha Round – would lift another 160 million people out of poverty.
Skepticism toward free trade hurts the world’s poorest.
While other US policies and tweets by President Donald Trump get far more coverage, the current administration’s rejection of free trade could be the biggest tragedy.
Humanity’s success in reducing poverty is an extraordinary achievement, and one that we are far too reticent about acknowledging.
We need to make sure that we don’t lose sight of what got us this far – and what justifies the hope of an even better future.

Why the World Cup Mattered
PARIS – The seventeenth-century philosopher and satirist Jean de La Bruyère once quipped that, “Corneille portrays men as they should be, Racine depicts them as they are.”
For Europeans, and even more so for the French, the 2018 World Cup was a Corneillian event.
The month-long soccer tournament in Russia offered an enchanted respite from a tumultuous world and revealed the better angels of our nature.
In the counter-reality of the tournament, a mood of self-confidence, altruism, and openness to the “other” prevailed.
At least for a while, the chauvinism, alienation, and despair that have dominated this era of populist nationalism seemed to be forgotten.
Geographically speaking, all four of the semifinalists – France, Croatia, Belgium, and England – hailed from the Old Continent.
Denounce Europe for its supposed weakness and decadence all you want. When it comes to the world’s most popular sport, Europe is king.
Moreover, it is clear that Africa is the soccer continent of the future, whereas Latin America is the continent of the past.
Having won the Cup in 1930 and again in 1950, Uruguay was once the smallest country (by population) to reach the final. But that honor is now shared by the brave team fielded by Croatia, the newest EU member state.
In stark contrast to the “real world,” the two leading powers, the United States and China, played no role in the tournament.
Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger’s dream of turning the US into a great soccer power has proved to be more difficult than he had hoped.
And China under President Xi Jinping remains a soccer lightweight, despite having invested billions of dollars in the sport.
Instead, North America was represented with brio by Mexico, and Asia by Japan and South Korea.
The strange divergence between the real world and the world of soccer this year was also evident in expressions of nationalist emotion.
The great Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges once condemned the sport for its role in fueling toxic forms of nationalism (such as the short-lived “Football War” between Honduras and El Salvador in 1969).
But in the 2018 World Cup – a century after the end of the nationalist bloodbath that was World War I – a “soft,” even gentle nationalism prevailed.
Russia is hardly an exponent of soft power, yet it deserves credit for the absence of violence during the tournament.
International press reports showed Ukrainian and Russian fans fraternizing like old friends.
Whereas the Vietnam War-era Woodstock festival exemplified the slogan “Make Love, Not War,” the de facto slogan of the 2018 Cup seems to have been “Balls, Not Bombs.”
In addition to channeling a more constructive form of nationalism, the semifinalists and their fans also embodied effective collective action, altruism, openness, and tolerance.
Interestingly, the teams that relied on a single star player – whether Cristiano Ronaldo of Portugal, Lionel Messi of Argentina, or Neymar of Brazil – all failed to advance beyond the quarterfinals.
In the real world nowadays, people are increasingly tempted to erect walls and close themselves off from “others.”
And yet, the strength of the winning team, France, was in its diversity.
This year’s chant of “Liberté, Egalité, Mbappé” (for the 19-year-old French forward Kylian Mbappé) was a more Enlightened version of the slogan from France’s victory in 1998: “Zidane for President.”
On the eve of the 2017 French presidential election, many political commentators repeated the mantra, “never two without three.”
After the United Kingdom’s Brexit referendum and the election of US President Donald Trump, they warned, a victory for Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Front could complete the trifecta.
Similarly, at the start of 2018, many French commentators seemed to think that we were approaching another “May 1968” or “December 1995,” when mass strikes and street protests paralyzed the entire country.
Although there have been limited strikes against French President Emmanuel Macron’s reform agenda, these commentators got it wrong.
The closest parallel to this year is not 1968 or 1995, but 1998, when France first won the World Cup.
Domestically, France’s victory likely will have little effect, if any, on Macron’s popularity.
Soccer emotions are intense, but generally fleeting.
On the international scene, however, France’s win could have a longer-lasting impact.
No one can deny that “France is back,” at least in terms of soccer.
The country has emerged as an oasis of dynamism, realism, and youthful enthusiasm, much of which is also reflected in Macron himself.
An obvious foil is Germany.
Usually a soccer powerhouse, the German team was eliminated in the first round of this year’s tournament, just as its politics were entering a deeper malaise.
In geopolitical terms, if one were to name just two winners this year, the titles would have to go to Russia and France.

World Cup Heralds a New Korea
The euphoria of fans whose team wins a major sporting event is ephemeral.
But, prominent professors at Korean universities tell me that the unprecedented success of the Korean team in the current World Cup competition is causing a turning point in Korean attitudes towards their own society and economy.
Why?
Many Koreans, especially those who studied or lived in the West, complain about the "cronyism", and the resulting importance of "connections" in all walks of Korean life, which they see as pervasive features of Korean society.
They claim that such rampant cronyism is preventing Korea from catching up economically with the West, despite the fact that Korea soon will have as much human capital as western countries.
To understand Korean cronyism we have to see it as one aspect of a set of related social conventions.
Koreans accept a sense of knowing one's place in society that seems extreme to Americans.
In social interactions, and also in business dealings, Koreans maintain a hierarchy that seems to weigh age more highly than performance.
Also, although admission to elite universities is as meritocratic in Korea as in the West, the outcome of the university entrance competition has a more important and more permanent effect on one's place in Korean society.
It is only a slight exaggeration to say that in America people have to prove themselves continually, whereas in traditional Korean society people have only to prove themselves once, then they can be set for life due in large measure to the network of crony contacts that initial success will have provided.
What do Korean cronyism and related social conventions have to do with the World Cup?
In the past cronyism apparently has been as pervasive in the selection of Korean teams for international sports competitions as in other areas of Korean society.
But, two years ago when the Korean soccer football association hired the Dutchman, Guus Hiddink, to coach the Korean national soccer team, Hiddink made it clear that he would select his players based on merit alone.
The performance of the Korean team in the 2002 World Cup competition is demonstrating to every Korean in a way that is easily seen that meritocracy yields better results than cronyism.
It also helps that Hiddink has been able to use his coaching skills to bring out in his team the strengths of the Korean national character: intelligence, discipline, tenacity, and perseverance.
Of course, Korean traditionalists reject criticism of what westernized Koreans call cronyism.
Traditionalists argue that criticism of cronyism is really criticism of social solidarity and responsibility, which they see as positive features of Korean society.
Traditionalists also argue that meritocracy implies individualism, and that too much individualism and too little social solidarity and responsibility are negative features of western society.
Some traditionalists even might claim that they do not want Koreans to be as rich as westerners if that requires Koreans to be as individualistic as westerners.
The Hiddink phenomenon did not emerge suddenly out of thin air.
The accumulation of gradual changes that have already occurred in Korean society made it acceptable to import a westerner to coach the Korean national soccer team and to allow him to establish a meritocratic regime.
But Hiddink has expedited the process of change within Korean society, and his success has made it look revolutionary.
It remains to be seen how fast, in what ways, and with what effects, Korean society will continue to change.
Koreans are talking about learning the lessons of Hiddink.
But the western model of a meritocratic society is not easy to emulate.
A soccer team is a relatively simple organization.
Implementing the lessons of Hiddink throughout Korean society will present more difficult challenges.
Whatever the outcome, it seems that in the case of the 2002 World Cup the effects of success in a major sporting event will not be ephemeral.

The World Economy in 2018
STANFORD – All major macroeconomic indicators – growth, unemployment, and inflation – suggest that 2017 will be the American economy’s best year in a decade.
And the global economy is enjoying broad, synchronized growth beyond what anyone expected.
The question now is whether this strong performance will continue in 2018.
The answer, of course, will depend on monetary, fiscal, trade, and related policies in the United States and around the world.
And yet it is hard to predict what policy proposals will emerge in 2018.
There are relatively new heads of state in the US, France, and the United Kingdom; German leaders still have not formed a governing coalition since the general election in September; and the US Federal Reserve has a new chair awaiting confirmation.
Moreover, major changes in important developing economies such as Argentina, Saudi Arabia, and Brazil have made the future outlook even murkier.
Still, we should hope for the best.
First and foremost, we should hope that synchronized global growth at a rate of just under 4% will continue in 2018, as the International Monetary Fund projected in October.
Growth not only raises incomes, but also makes vexing problems such as bad bank loans and budget deficits more manageable.
As former US President John F. Kennedy famously said in an October 1963 speech in which he promoted his proposed corporate and personal tax reductions, “a rising tide lifts all boats.”
For my part, I predict that the global recovery will continue, but at a slightly slower growth rate of around 3.5%.
The two most obvious risks to keep an eye on will be Europe, where a cyclical upturn could stall, and the oil-rich Middle East, where tensions could flare up once again.
Second, let us hope that the Fed, guided by the steady hand of its new chair, Jerome “Jay” Powell, will continue or even accelerate its monetary-policy normalization, both by raising its benchmark federal funds rate, and by shrinking its engorged balance sheet.
And we should hope that economic conditions allow the other major central banks, especially the European Central Bank, to follow suit.
On this front, I predict that the major central banks will continue to normalize monetary policies more gradually than is necessary.
The biggest risk here is that markets may try to test the Fed under its new leadership, for example, if inflation rises faster than anticipated.
Third, let us hope that the Republican tax package will, if enacted, deliver on its promise of increased investment, output, productivity, and wages over the coming decade.
Here, I predict that the legislation will pass, and that investment in the US over the next few years will be relatively higher than if no action had been taken.
To be sure, whether investment will rise from its currently subdued level will depend on many other factors than the corporate-tax rate.
But the tax package can still be expected to boost output, productivity, and wages.
The question is not if, but when.
If the full effects of the legislation are not felt before the 2018 or 2020 elections, that lag could prove politically consequential.
The biggest danger is that its benefits will be delayed, and that its key provisions will be reversed whenever the Democrats are back in power.
Fourth, let us hope that governments everywhere begin to address the looming crisis in public-pension and health-care costs, which have been rising for decades.
As social programs become costlier, they crowd out government expenditures on necessities such as defense, while generating ever more pressure to impose higher growth-suppressing taxes.
Europe, in particular, must not let its cyclical rebound lull it into complacency.
Many European Union member states still need to reduce their government debt, and the eurozone needs to resolve its “zombie bank” crisis.
Beyond that, structural labor-market reforms of the kind French President Emmanuel Macron is pursuing would be most welcome.
Unfortunately, I’m afraid that progress on structural reforms will be sporadic, at best.
The danger is that slow growth will not lead to sufficient wage gains and job creation to defuse the ticking time bomb of high youth unemployment in many countries.
Another risk is that reform attempts could provoke a political backlash that would be harmful to long-term investment.
Fifth, let us hope that the eurozone can avoid a currency crisis.
This will depend largely on whether German Chancellor Angela Merkel can form a coalition government and restore political stability to Europe’s largest economy.
Sixth, we should hope that the EU and the UK can agree on a reasonable Brexit deal that will preserve fairly strong trade relations.
The main risk here is that localized declines in trade could spill over and cause broader harm.
And, beyond Europe, let us hope that negotiations between the US, Canada, and Mexico over the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) will result in an arrangement that still facilitates continental trade.
For trade generally, the biggest risk is that the Trump administration could start a lose-lose trade dispute, owing to its understandable eagerness to help American manufacturing workers.
Seventh, let us hope that new policies targeting information and communication technology (ICT) strike the right balance among all stakeholders’ competing and legitimate concerns.
On one hand, there is reason to worry about certain Internet companies’ concentration of market power, particularly in online content and distribution, and about the effects of new technologies on personal privacy, law enforcement, and national security.
On the other hand, new technological advances could deliver immense economic gains.
It is easy to envision a scenario of too much regulation, or of too little.
It is also easy to envision a large-scale public backlash against the major technology companies, particularly if poor self-policing or a refusal to cooperate with law enforcement leads to some horrible event.
Here, I predict that achieving an appropriate policy balance will take years.
If some future event strikes an emotional chord, the public’s mood could swing dramatically.
Ultimately, however, I suspect that competition and innovation will survive the forthcoming regulations.
Finally, and most important, let us hope that terrorism is thwarted everywhere, conflicts subside, democracy and capitalism regain some momentum, and greater civility and honest dialogue return to the public domain.
Should that happen in 2018, it will be a very good year indeed.

The World Economy Without China
NEW HAVEN – Is the Chinese economy about to implode?
With its debt overhangs and property bubbles, its zombie state-owned enterprises and struggling banks, China is increasingly portrayed as the next disaster in a crisis-prone world.
I remain convinced that such fears are overblown, and that China has the strategy, wherewithal, and commitment to achieve a dramatic structural transformation into a services-based consumer society while successfully dodging daunting cyclical headwinds.
But I certainly recognize that this is now a minority opinion.
For example, US Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew continues to express the rather puzzling view that the United States “can’t be the only engine in the world economy.”
Actually, it’s not: the Chinese economy is on track to contribute well over four times as much to global growth as the US this year.
But maybe Lew is already assuming the worst for China in his assessment of the world economy.
So what if the China doubters are right?
What if China’s economy does indeed come crashing down, with its growth rate plunging into low single digits, or even negative territory, as would be the case in most crisis economies?
China would suffer, of course, but so would an already-shaky global economy.
With all the handwringing over the Chinese economy, it’s worth considering this thought experiment in detail.
For starters, without China, the world economy would already be in recession.
China’s growth rate this year appears set to hit 6.7% – considerably higher than most forecasters have been expecting.
According to the International Monetary Fund – the official arbiter of global economic metrics – the Chinese economy accounts for 17.3% of world GDP (measured on a purchasing-power-parity basis).
A 6.7% increase in Chinese real GDP thus translates into about 1.2 percentage points of world growth.
Absent China, that contribution would need to be subtracted from the IMF’s downwardly revised 3.1% estimate for world GDP growth in 2016, dragging it down to 1.9% – well below the 2.5% threshold commonly associated with global recessions.
Of course, that’s just the direct effect of a world without China.
Then there are cross-border linkages with other major economies.
The so-called resource economies – namely, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Russia, and Brazil – would be hit especially hard.
As a resource-intensive growth juggernaut, China has transformed these economies, which collectively account for nearly 9% of world GDP.
While all of them argue that they have diversified economic structures that are not overly dependent on Chinese commodity demand, currency markets say otherwise: whenever China’s growth expectations are revised – upward or downward – their exchange rates move in tandem.
The IMF currently projects that these five economies will contract by a combined 0.7% in 2016, reflecting ongoing recessions in Russia and Brazil and modest growth in the other three.
Needless to say, in a China implosion scenario, this baseline estimate would be revised downward significantly.
The same would be the case for China’s Asian trading partners – most of which remain export-dependent economies, with the Chinese market their largest source of external demand.
That is true not only of smaller Asian developing economies such as Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand, but also of the larger and more developed economies in the region, such as Japan, Korea, and Taiwan.
Collectively, these six China-dependent Asian economies make up another 11% of world GDP.
A China implosion could easily knock at least one percentage point off their combined growth rate.
The United States is also a case in point.
China is America’s third-largest and most rapidly growing export market.
In a China-implosion scenario, that export demand would all but dry up – knocking approximately 0.2-0.3 percentage points off already subpar US economic growth of around 1.6% in 2016.
Finally, there is Europe to consider.
Growth in Germany, long the engine of an otherwise sclerotic Continental economy, remains heavily dependent on exports.
That is due increasingly to the importance of China – now Germany’s third-largest export market, after the European Union and the United States.
In a China implosion scenario, German economic growth could also be significantly lower, dragging down the rest of a German-led Europe.
Interestingly, in its just-released October update of the World Economic Outlook, the IMF devotes an entire chapter to what it calls a China spillover analysis – a model-based assessment of the global impacts of a China slowdown.
Consistent with the arguments above, the IMF focuses on linkages to commodity exporters, Asian exporters, and what they call “systemic advanced economies” (Germany, Japan, and the US) that would be most exposed to a Chinese downturn.
By their reckoning, the impact on Asia would be the largest, followed closely by the resource economies; the sensitivity of the three developed economies is estimated to be about half that of China’s non-Japan Asian trading partners.
The IMF research suggests that China’s global spillovers would add about another 25% to the direct effects of China’s growth shortfall.
That means that if Chinese economic growth vanished into thin air, in accordance with our thought experiment, the sum of the direct effects (1.2 percentage points of global growth) and indirect spillovers (roughly another 0.3 percentage points) would essentially halve the current baseline estimate of 2016 global growth, from 3.1% to 1.6%.
While that would be far short of the record 0.1% global contraction in 2009, it wouldn’t be much different than two earlier deep world recessions, in 1975 (1% growth) and 1982 (0.7%).
I may be one of the only China optimists left.
While I am hardly upbeat about prospects for the global economy, I think the world faces far bigger problems than a major meltdown in China.
Yet I would be the first to concede that a post-crisis world economy without Chinese growth would be in grave difficulty.
China bears need to be careful what they wish for.

The Return of Currency Wars
NEW YORK – The recent decision by the Bank of Japan to increase the scope of its quantitative easing is a signal that another round of currency wars may be under way.
The BOJ’s effort to weaken the yen is a beggar-thy-neighbor approach that is inducing policy reactions throughout Asia and around the world.
Central banks in China, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and Thailand, fearful of losing competitiveness relative to Japan, are easing their own monetary policies – or will soon ease more.
The European Central Bank and the central banks of Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, and a few Central European countries are likely to embrace quantitative easing or use other unconventional policies to prevent their currencies from appreciating.
All of this will lead to a strengthening of the US dollar, as growth in the United States is picking up and the Federal Reserve has signaled that it will begin raising interest rates next year.
But, if global growth remains weak and the dollar becomes too strong, even the Fed may decide to raise interest rates later and more slowly to avoid excessive dollar appreciation.
The cause of the latest currency turmoil is clear: In an environment of private and public deleveraging from high debts, monetary policy has become the only available tool to boost demand and growth.
Fiscal austerity has exacerbated the impact of deleveraging by exerting a direct and indirect drag on growth.
Lower public spending reduces aggregate demand, while declining transfers and higher taxes reduce disposable income and thus private consumption.
In the eurozone, a sudden stop of capital flows to the periphery and the fiscal restraints imposed, with Germany’s backing, by the European Union, the International Monetary Fund, and the ECB have been a massive impediment to growth.
In Japan, an excessively front-loaded consumption-tax increase killed the recovery achieved this year.
In the US, a budget sequester and other tax and spending policies led to a sharp fiscal drag in 2012-2014.
And in the United Kingdom, self-imposed fiscal consolidation weakened growth until this year.
Globally, the asymmetric adjustment of creditor and debtor economies has exacerbated this recessionary and deflationary spiral.
Countries that were overspending, under-saving, and running current-account deficits have been forced by markets to spend less and save more.
Not surprisingly, their trade deficits have been shrinking. But most countries that were over-saving and under-spending have not saved less and spent more; their current-account surpluses have been growing, aggravating the weakness of global demand and thus undermining growth.
As fiscal austerity and asymmetric adjustment have taken their toll on economic performance, monetary policy has borne the burden of supporting faltering growth via weaker currencies and higher net exports.
But the resulting currency wars are partly a zero-sum game: If one currency is weaker, another currency must be stronger; and if one country’s trade balance improves, another’s must worsen.
Of course, monetary easing is not purely zero-sum. Easing can boost growth by lifting asset prices (equities and housing), reducing private and public borrowing costs, and limiting the risk of a fall in actual and expected inflation.
Given fiscal drag and private deleveraging, lack of sufficient monetary easing in recent years would have led to double and triple dip recession (as occurred, for example, in the eurozone).
But the overall policy mix has been sub-optimal, with too much front-loaded fiscal consolidation and too much unconventional monetary policy (which has become less effective over time).
A better approach in advanced economies would have comprised less fiscal consolidation in the short run and more investment in productive infrastructure, combined with a more credible commitment to medium- and long-term fiscal adjustment – and less aggressive monetary easing.
You can lead a horse to liquidity, but you can’t make it drink.
In a world where private aggregate demand is weak and unconventional monetary policy eventually becomes like pushing on a string, the case for slower fiscal consolidation and productive public infrastructure spending is compelling.
Such spending offers returns that are certainly higher than the low interest rates that most advanced economies face today, and infrastructure needs are massive in both advanced and emerging economies (with the exception of China, which has overinvested in infrastructure).
Moreover, public investment works on both the demand and supply sides.
It not only boosts aggregate demand directly; it also expands potential output by increasing the stock of productivity-boosting capital.
Unfortunately, the political economy of austerity has led to sub-optimal outcomes.
In a fiscal crunch, the first spending cuts hit productive public investments, because governments prefer to protect current – and often inefficient – spending on public-sector jobs and transfer payments to the private sector.
As a result, the global recovery remains anemic in most advanced economies (with the partial exception of the US and the UK) and now also in the major emerging countries, where growth has slowed sharply in the last two years.
The right policies – less fiscal austerity in the short run, more public investment spending, and less reliance on monetary easing – are the opposite of those that have been pursued by the world’s major economies.
No wonder global growth keeps on disappointing.
In a sense, we are all Japanese now.

A Roadmap to End Cholera
GENEVA – “Where is your toilet?”
This is often the first question I ask when I visit the site of a cholera outbreak anywhere in the world.
More often than not, the answer is: “We don’t have one.
We go wherever we can.”
Cholera, an ancient disease, has become a disease of poverty.
It does not discriminate geographically, but it preys mostly on vulnerable communities in areas with poor sanitation.
Carried by contaminated floodwaters to sources of drinking water, transported by unsuspecting travelers, or brought into homes on produce irrigated with untreated sewage, the Vibrio cholerae bacterium settles in the small intestine after it is ingested, causing severe diarrhea and dehydration.
Those who are fortunate enough never to have witnessed cholera’s effects firsthand might assume that it is just another stomach bug.
But without swift medical attention, cholera can sap the life out of an adult or child in a matter of hours.
Each year, cholera claims the lives of an estimated 95,000 people; many who die are children.
This year, images of listless, glassy-eyed cholera victims awaiting treatment have emerged in countries worldwide.
The disease has spread at an unprecedented rate in Yemen, where more than 2,000 people have died since April. Cholera outbreaks are ongoing in Somalia, South Sudan, Haiti, and other countries across sub-Saharan Africa and Asia.
But the saddest fact about cholera’s recent toll on human lives is that every single death was preventable.
The world already has the knowledge and tools to control cholera effectively, but existing resources are not being aligned with the necessary global commitments.
That is why the new global strategy developed by the Global Task Force on Cholera Control, a diverse network of technical partners, is so vital.
Ending Cholera – A Global Roadmap to 2030 emphasizes a shift to proactive approaches, and aims to reduce cholera deaths by 90% over the next decade.
With full implementation, the plan could also help as many as 20 countries eliminate disease transmission in the same timeframe.
Based on three pillars – early detection, integrated prevention tactics, and coordination between countries and partners – the roadmap provides a concrete path for ending cholera as a public health threat.
Once cholera grips a community, it becomes increasingly difficult to control.
It is important, therefore, that the disease is not forgotten even when it is not claiming victims.
A multi-sector approach that includes investments in water, sanitation, and hygiene – so-called WASH services – can keep cholera at bay. So can the proactive use of oral cholera vaccines and quick access to treatments, such as oral rehydration solution and intravenous fluids.
Improving WASH infrastructure is the most effective path to prevention, though implementing these services will take time in countries with fewer resources.
For this reason, the roadmap also encourages the preemptive and large-scale deployment of oral vaccines in cholera hotspots.
The vaccines work immediately, and can prevent cholera for up to three years, serving as a bridge to the implementation of longer-term solutions.
Oral cholera vaccines are available via a global stockpile maintained by the World Health Organization, with support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.
More than 15 million doses have been distributed to 18 countries since the program’s creation in 2013.
Next year, the stockpile is set to increase to more than 25 million doses, up from two million when it began.
Ending cholera as a health threat by 2030, as global partners and the WHO recently pledged, will require sustained collaboration and commitment from cholera-affected countries, technical partners, and international donors.
The goal may seem daunting, given that millions of people around the world are at risk of contracting the disease each year.
But with urbanization, climate change, and other factors likely to increase the threat of infection, it is a goal that must be met.
The roadmap makes this possible.
Implementing the plan will prove to be a cost-effective solution for countries saddled with responding to frequent cholera outbreaks.
That is one reason why action is urgently needed.
But embracing the strategy is also the right thing to do for the international community.
Governments have a moral obligation to ensure that no one succumbs to a preventable death.
It is an obligation the WHO shares, and it is why we will work hard to help the world meet the ambitious targets we have set.
We have the tools needed to beat cholera.
Now, with a plan in place, there can no longer be any excuse not to put them to use.

A Tipping Point Missed
WASHINGTON, DC – Before America and the world settle in firmly to the new Donald Trump-based reality, let’s take a little trip down the road not taken.
Suppose we had woken up last Wednesday morning to a President-elect Hillary Clinton.
And let’s say that, instead of former Portuguese Prime Minister António Guterres, New Zealand’s Helen Clark or Bulgaria’s Kristalina Georgieva had been picked to succeed Ban Ki-moon as United Nations Secretary-General.
Clinton would have joined the United Kingdom’s Theresa May and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, helping achieve critical mass in the G7.
And a female UN Secretary-General would have placed women at the helm of two of the world’s three biggest international organizations (France’s Christine Lagarde already runs the International Monetary Fund).
With so many female leaders, we would have begun to answer the question: what happens when women run the world?
Would the world be better for women?
Would it even be different?
According to sociologists, female leaders are of two schools: Queen Bees, who are less likely to help other women advance, and Righteous Women, who make the advancement of other women a priority.
Most early pioneers, such as the UK’s Margaret Thatcher, India’s Indira Gandhi, and Israel’s Golda Meir, were Queen Bees; all of them eschewed feminism.
More recently, Righteous Women have prevailed.
Leaders like Argentina’s Cristina Kirchner, Brazil’s Dilma Rousseff, and Iceland’s Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir have all sought, in one way or another, to empower women and help them advance in their countries.
Merkel and May have tended to be more like Queen Bees, while Clinton, Lagarde, Clark, and Georgieva are more like Righteous Women.
To be fair, the first woman leader in a male-dominated culture must often outman the men. Seeking to advance other women can highlight her own womanhood and thereby weaken her.
Clinton, for example, was the third woman US Secretary of State but the first who felt secure enough to be able to champion the cause of women and girls worldwide.
As President, she pledged, half her cabinet would be women, and she would further the State Department initiatives launched during her tenure.
Yes, she also would have been careful to avoid being defined as a woman president.
Still, just the presence of a plurality of women has an impact.
For example, studies of US courts with multiple judges show that male judges are more willing to hear bias cases when one woman is on the bench, and significantly more willing when a second woman is added.
“Each of us,” noted Sandra Day O’Connor, the first female member of the US Supreme Court, who was renowned for not wanting to be perceived as a “female” justice, “brings to our job, whatever it is, our lifetime of experience and our values.”
In other words, women bring a fresh perspective, heard clearly only when a critical mass of them is present in any institution.
Consider a woman’s perspective on conflict.
Evidence does not support the stereotype that women are more pacifist than men – the peacemakers and settlers of male disputes.
Women can be Amazons; recall Thatcher’s prosecution of the Falklands War and her admonition to George H.W. Bush not to “go wobbly” in the run-up to the first Gulf War.
On the other hand, when men see wars, they naturally imagine the world of the warriors, whereas women see themselves in the women who must try to shelter their families from forces they cannot control.
That is precisely the diversity of perspective that is vital to decision-making.
And indeed, the Institute for Inclusive Security at Harvard’s Kennedy School has tracked the differences women make as part of peace negotiations.
An acute awareness of the magnitude of civilian suffering in conflicts such as the Syrian civil war or the ongoing horrors in the Congo Basin, and an appreciation of how cycles of violence perpetuate themselves over generations, can actually make women much more likely to urge the use of force in interventions.
Former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright famously chided Colin Powell for his reluctance to involve the US military in the Balkans in the 1990s, in part because of her own family’s experience as Czech refugees from Communism.
Overall, a woman leader’s decisions are no more predictable than a male leader’s.
Women are not monolithic: they have various ideological backgrounds and diverse governing styles.
But when the world finally reaches the point when women are not a rarity at the tables of power, when their numbers reach a tipping point, their voices will be heard differently, and their opinions will hold more weight with the men around them.
Women came closer in 2016 than in any other era to reaching that tipping point.
But we may still have to wait decades to find out what will happen when we finally do.

Homesick Politics
MADRID – World order – or the lack thereof – is a hot topic these days.
Our fixation with the future of global structures and systems is evident everywhere – in the news and at conferences, on bestseller lists, even in popular television shows.
People are anxious.
The world seems to be undergoing fundamental change: new actors are emerging on the world stage, previously sacrosanct rules of international behavior are being openly defied, and a new wave of technological progress is disrupting entire industries and economic sectors.
In our quest for structure and predictability – a natural impulse in times of rapid change – we are desperate for hints about how the world, and our role in it, will develop.
It is of course vital in such situations that we identify the best, or at least the most feasible, way forward; predictability provides a foundation for cost-benefit analysis and strategic thinking.
The problem arises when our yearning for certainty overwhelms rational thinking, taking our ideas and actions in an unproductive – or even dangerous – direction.
The current trend toward rose-colored retrospection is a case in point.
Faced with political, economic, geostrategic, and social uncertainty, policymakers have increasingly succumbed to the allure of nostalgia, promising a return to what they portray as the familiar and complete rules and practices of the past.
In Russia, President Vladimir Putin has been operating according to a nineteenth-century worldview, in which great powers dominate their spheres of influence unchallenged.
As he noted at last October’s meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club, “The bear will not even bother to ask permission.
Here, we consider it the master of the taiga.”
The Islamic State is attempting to return to an even more distant past.
Its adherents espouse a medieval ninth-century doctrine to justify their effort to reestablish the caliphate, in which “the legality of all emirates, groups, states, and organizations becomes null” and summary execution and slavery are mandatory.
The West, too, has fallen into the trap of nostalgia, clinging to a late-twentieth-century conception of order in which it makes the rules and can choose whether to follow them.
The latest example of this anachronistic perspective is America’s ham-fisted (not to mention failed) attempt to stem support for the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, after repeatedly refusing to provide a greater voice for the world’s emerging powers in the Bretton Woods institutions.
Nostalgia has also emerged as a major factor in many countries’ domestic affairs.
Throughout Europe, populist parties – from the right-wing United Kingdom Independence Party to the far-left Syriza in Greece – seek a return to the ostensibly simpler and happier times of national control and closed borders.
In the US, a prominent strain of jurisprudence defends the “original intent” of the Constitution’s framers, while Republicans are shifting toward isolationism and Democrats are denouncing free-trade agreements.
But nostalgia offers no solutions – only a dream of escape.
Looking backward gets us no closer to what we want; on the contrary, it is a surefire way to miss the challenges – and miss out on the opportunities – that lie before us.
Trying to advance one’s interests based on the rules of the past is like trying to solve today’s crossword puzzle using yesterday’s clues.
Let’s face it: the halcyon world to which many people are so eager to return – before, say, the European Union or the United Nations or even the nation-state – never really existed.
As Marcel Proust noted: “Remembrance of things past is not necessarily the remembrance of things as they were.”
The past is being abridged and sugarcoated in order to portray it as superior to the widespread tumult and misery of today.
Over time, nostalgia has come to have a benign connotation.
But the word – a combination of the Greek nostos (homecoming) and algos (pain) – was coined to describe the disease of “acute homesickness.”
Perhaps it would be beneficial to return to that definition of nostalgia, at least in its political manifestation, as something more akin to an illness: a condition that distorts reality and impedes the formulation of effective solutions for real-world challenges.
No worldview rooted in the nineteenth century – much less in the ninth century – is adequate to the complexities of today’s globalized world.
Likewise, the rise of new powers and non-state actors means that rule making (and breaking) can no longer be restricted to a small Western club.
And the intensity of global competition means that European countries cannot hope to thrive independently of one another.
Flimsy ideas thrive in the absence of a viable alternative. That is why a period of reflection on world order is so important.
But, rather than allowing ourselves to be swept up in the regressive tide of nostalgia, we need to engage one another in a constructive conversation about the challenges that we actually face and propose new ideas for addressing them.

Worlds Apart
Macroeconomic policies, financial globalization, and changes in labor market institutions have exacerbated inequality in recent decades, not only in income and wealth, but also in access to education, healthcare, social protection, as well as in political participation and influence.
Even within countries experiencing rapid economic growth, an array of factors, exacerbated by tremendous demographic changes, has conspired to transmit inequality of knowledge, social responsibility, and life chances from one generation to the next.
As surveyed in the United Nations report The Inequality Predicament, few countries, rich or poor, have proved immune to the global trend of rising inequality, or to its consequences for education, health, and social welfare.
Of course, there is no simple causal relationship linking poverty and inequality to violence.
But inequality and a sense of deprivation do contribute to resentment and social instability, threatening security.
Excluded and facing bleak life prospects, young people, in particular, often experience anomie and may turn to anti-social behavior, including violence.
Nor is there a simple explanation of what causes poverty.
Clearly, however, poverty arises from various complex conditions, and its amelioration requires a multidimensional approach.
It is hard to imagine, for example, how to “make poverty history” without also generating enough decent work, educational opportunities, and healthcare for all.
To be sure, the world has seen progress on some fronts in recent decades.
Access to education for girls has improved, and some gender gaps have been reduced.
Despite AIDS and the resurgence of malaria and tuberculosis, life expectancy has increased in much of the world due to improved public health systems.
Overall, however, the inequality gaps are large and, in many cases, growing.
The most important determinant of income inequality today is wealth inequality, with the increasing concentration of asset ownership in recent years principally responsible for greater income inequality in most countries.
Meanwhile, growing unemployment, widening skill and productivity gaps, and the “informalization” or “casualization” of labor markets have exacerbated income inequalities worldwide, as the number of “working poor” and the incidence of “jobless growth” has spread.
Nor have stabilization and structural adjustment programs, imposed since the 1980’s, delivered on their promise of achieving higher economic growth.
Growth in much of the world during the past quarter-century has been slower than in the previous 25 years, despite more rapid growth in East Asia, India, and a few other countries.
Such growth differences suggest that overall global inequality may not have increased unequivocally.
But inequalities at the national level have deepened in most countries in recent years, largely due to economic liberalization at both the national and international levels.
Indeed, in much of the world, such economic reforms have actually undermined growth rates as well as the progressive role of government, while otherwise increasing overall inequalities.
The few exceptions have been due largely to continued or new progressive government interventions.
But they are exceptions: the cumulative impact of these reforms over the past 25 years has been greater inequality in most developed and developing countries, with rising unemployment, greater earnings disparities, reduced social protection, and environmental degradation.
International financial liberalization, for example, has undermined the use of more inclusive and targeted developmental credit to promote desired economic activities.
In addition, contrary to the promises of its proponents, financial liberalization has actually resulted in net capital flows from the capital-poor to the capital-rich over the long term, while increasing financial volatility and weakening economic activity.
Meanwhile, free-trade negotiations seem to ignore historical trends.
Developing countries’ international terms of trade have worsened: prices of primary commodities have declined in relation to manufactures, as have tropical agriculture prices against temperate agriculture, and prices of generic manufactures have fallen relative to output protected by intellectual property rights.
As a result, trade liberalization of manufactures has resulted in de-industrialization and greater unemployment in much of the world, as in the case of garments this year.
And, while agricultural trade liberalization may enhance export earnings for some poor countries, the main beneficiaries will be the more well-to-do agricultural exporters.
Countries that import currently subsidized food will be worse off.
The “retreat of the state” in much of the developing world in recent decades has involved a generally reduced role for government, including the capacity to lead and sustain development, as well as its progressive social interventions in areas such as public education, health, housing, and utilities.
The economic liberalization carried out in much of the world in the last 25 years was a flawed policy from the start, and its consequences have become glaringly obvious.
Unless the world refocuses economic policies to address the adverse impact of economic inequality on growth and poverty reduction, the poor and the privileged will continue to live worlds apart.

Whither the Multilateral Trading System?
BRUSSELS – Free trade seems to have few supporters these days.
Though actual trade volumes are recovering from the post-crisis recession and drop in commodity prices, “globalization” has become increasingly contentious, as exemplified by the election of US President Donald Trump on the back of a promise to rip up international agreements and get tough on trade partners.
What does this mean for the future of the rules-based trading system?
Some 60 years ago, when the current rules-based global trading system was conceived, the United States was the world’s sole economic “hyperpower,” possessing unquestioned dominance in the day’s most advanced manufacturing industries.
With enough power to impose rules, and enough dominance to be able to count on accruing the largest share of the benefits, it could – and did – perform the role of “benevolent hegemon.”
As Japan and Europe recovered from World War II – with the latter getting an added boost from economic integration – America’s lead began to dwindle, and by the 1970s and 1980s, the US was sharing power over the world’s trade agenda with Europe.
Nonetheless, because the US and Europe share so many common interests, they generally adhered to a cooperative approach.
It was not until imports began to overwhelm a growing number of industries in the US, fueling the emergence of large and persistent external deficits, that the country’s trade policy became more defensive, creating friction with many of its partners.
Yet, even then, US leaders understood the value of the liberal multilateral trading system, and supported the establishment, in 1995, of the World Trade Organization as the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The WTO’s creation amounted to a major step forward, as it addressed not just tariffs, but also other trade barriers, including indirect barriers arising from domestic regulations.
Given the complexity of assessing how domestic regulations might impede trade, especially compared to judging whether a tariff has been correctly applied, the WTO needed effective dispute-settlement mechanisms, with members agreeing to binding arbitration.
The system worked, because its major members recognized the legitimacy of independent panels, even if they sometimes deliver politically inconvenient judgments.
Yet this recognition is now increasingly in doubt.
Consider what type of economy would support a rules-based system.
After WWII, the US supported such a system, because of its unassailable economic supremacy.
An open rules-based system would also be highly appealing in a world comprising only small countries, none of which could hope to gain by relying on its relative economic power.
Things become more complicated when the global economy includes a small number of economies of similar size, larger than the small economies from the previous example, but not large enough to dominate the system alone.
That is the scenario the Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman considered in a 1989 paper on bilateralism, in which he reported that a world consisting of three major trading blocs constitutes the worst constellation for trade, as a lack of explicit cooperation among all three would lead to increasing trade barriers.
Unfortunately, this is exactly the situation in which the global economy finds itself today.
There are three dominant economies or trading blocs – China, the European Union, and the US – with very similar trade volumes (exports plus imports) of around $4 trillion each.
(Japan, which was a strong contender 25 years ago, now has a much smaller trade volume.)
Together, the G3 economies account for 40% of world trade and 45% of global GDP.
With economic power distributed in this way, explicit cooperation by all three actors is crucial.
Yet there are compelling reasons why they would be reticent to pursue such cooperation.
Even if Trump weren’t president, the current global trading system would present problems for the US, whose trade policy has long focused on manufactured goods.
(Trade in raw materials has always been relatively free, and trade in agricultural goods has usually been considered special, and thus not subject to rules like the “most favored nation” principle, which applies to manufactures.)
Because the US is now self-sufficient in energy, it needs to export fewer manufactured goods than industrialized countries with no domestic energy resources.
Annual US exports of manufactured goods thus now amount to only about $1 trillion annually – significantly less than both the EU and China, which export almost twice as much in manufactured goods, despite having somewhat smaller economies.
To be sure, Trump is unlikely to start an outright trade war, because any US tariff would harm the interests of the country’s largest companies, which have invested huge sums in production facilities abroad.
Yet no individual firm will be willing to give up much of its political capital to defend the rules-based system, either, because it would have to bear the losses, while its competitors shared the gains.
The same goes for the G3 trading blocs: if the EU expends political capital to stop the US from undermining WTO mechanisms, China (and the rest of world) will reap most of the gains.
That dynamic goes some way toward explaining why China’s leaders, despite having proclaimed their support for the multilateral rules-based trading system, haven’t taken concrete action to reinforce it.
Their reticence is probably intensified by the assumption that, within the current generation, their country will dominate the global economy; at that point, they might no longer want to be bound by somebody else’s rules.
It does not help matters that the Communist Party of China has recently been empowered even further in all areas of the economy, with all major firms now having to accept a CPC representative on their board.
It is difficult to see how a dominant economic power governed by a single party – especially one with such extensive control over the economy – would accept the primacy of international rules and procedures over domestic considerations.
The conclusion is clear.
The world should prepare itself for the erosion of the rules-based trading system enshrined in the WTO.

Wrongheaded in Rio
COPENHAGEN – Tens of thousands of people will soon gather in Rio de Janeiro for the United Nations Earth Summit.
The participants, ranging from weary politicians to enthusiastic campaigners, are supposed to reignite global concern for the environment.
Unfortunately, the summit is likely to be a wasted opportunity.
The UN is showcasing the alluring promise of a “green economy,” focused on tackling global warming.
In fact, the summit is striking at the wrong target, neglecting the much greater environmental concerns of the vast majority of the world.
Global warming is by no means our main environmental threat.
Even if we assumed – unreasonably – that it caused all deaths from floods, droughts, heat waves, and storms, this total would amount to just 0.06% of all deaths in developing countries.
In comparison, 13% of all Third World deaths result from water and air pollution.
So, for each person who might die from global warming, about 210 people die from health problems that result from a lack of clean water and sanitation, from breathing smoke generated by burning dirty fuels (such as dried animal dung) indoors, and from breathing polluted air outdoors.
By focusing on measures to prevent global warming, the advanced countries might help to prevent many people from dying.
That sounds good until you realize that it means that 210 times as many people in poorer countries might die needlessly as a result – because the resources that could have saved them were spent on windmills, solar panels, biofuels, and other rich-world fixations.
But of course, poor countries’ tangible pollution problems are not trendy, and they do not engage outspoken campaigners, media, and governments the way that global warming can.
Nowhere are the failed priorities better illustrated than in the UN’s official, colorful “Rio+20” leaflet.
Here, the UN helpfully provides a layman’s explanation of the summit, along with examples of its envisioned “green economy” in action.
We see scary pictures of dry riverbeds (the result of global warming), along with plenty of pretty solutions like wind turbines and solar panels.
The problem is that green energy mostly is still much more expensive, less effective, and more intermittent than the alternatives.
Yet, the summit literature claims that it will boost economic growth and eradicate poverty. But seriously, why do well-meaning First Worlders think that the Third World should have energy technologies that are more expensive, feebler, and less reliable than their own?
Without a hint of irony, the leaflet is called “The Future We Want.” But, in a world where a billion people go to bed hungry, and where six million die each year from air and water pollution, most of those in the developing world likely have a very different set of priorities for their future.
The leaflet cheerfully claims that China’s shift “to a low-carbon growth strategy based on the development of renewable energy sources [has] created jobs, income, and revenue.”
In fact, over the past 25 years, China has quadrupled its CO2 emissions.
While China does produce about half of the world’s solar panels, 98% are exported to reap generous subsidies from rich-world markets.
Only 0.005% of China’s energy comes from solar panels.
China’s decades-long economic expansion has lifted 600 million people out of poverty, but the enormous pollution that this has entailed does not fit into Rio+20’s green narrative.
Likewise, the brochure explains that some farmers in Uganda have embraced organic farming.
Unfortunately, Africa is almost entirely organic now – leading to low yields, hunger, and deforestation.
Africa needs to boost its yields, and that means enabling farmers to use modern crops, fertilizers, and pesticides.
Producing less with more effort might appeal to well-fed First Worlders, but it is literally starving the poor.
Reading further, the leaflet gushes that France has created 90,000 jobs in the green economy. But the stark reality remains hidden: the average cost of each green job is more than $200,000 per year, which French taxpayers patently cannot afford.
And economic models show that France has lost as many or more jobs because of the extra costs of the subsidies.
Adding insult to injury, a beautiful photograph shows electric cars finishing the “Zero Emissions Race” in Geneva.
Omitted is the fact that most electricity still comes from burning fossil fuels, so the cars are anything but “zero” emissions. And, more importantly, most of our planet’s inhabitants still dream of owning some form of mechanized transport – which is unlikely to be an electric vehicle with a price tag of $50,000 or more.
In a world plagued by serious problems caused by air and water pollution, this breezy focus on trendy topics and unrealistic solutions is deeply disturbing.
A disconnected global elite is flying to Rio to tell the world’s poor to have a solar panel.
Rather than pandering to advanced countries’ obsessions, Rio+20 could do more good for humanity – and the planet – by focusing on the top environmental problems and their simple solutions.

An Opportunity for the WTO
ONTARIO – This December, trade ministers from around the world will converge in Buenos Aires for the World Trade Organization’s 11th Ministerial Conference.
With the United States, which has historically led the world toward trade liberalization, now actively stoking trade tensions, the meeting is set to be unlike any other.
The WTO’s ministerial gatherings are never easy.
Some kind of agreement is usually delivered, but only at the last minute, and its language is often vague.
This time, however, the outcome might be even more disappointing, with delegates unable to reach even a symbolic agreement that they can tout with an aggressive marketing campaign.
The current tensions over free trade, rooted in the uneven distribution of its benefits, cannot be resolved within the WTO, let alone by a ministerial gathering.
But that doesn’t mean that the upcoming conference must be for naught.
On the contrary, it should serve as a critical opportunity to initiate the update and recalibration that the WTO needs to remain an effective platform for international trade cooperation and consensus-building.
One key problem that must be addressed relates to “special and differential treatment” (S&D).
About two thirds of the WTO’s 164 members have declared themselves developing countries – a label that entitles them to S&D provisions, including the authority to maintain trade tariffs for a longer period of time.
With the WTO lacking any benchmarks or indicators to determine when a country should be weaned off S&D, it is no surprise that no developing country has ever “developed.”
To be sure, since S&D was first introduced in 1979, many developing countries have grown richer. But they have shown no indication that they are ready to relinquish the benefits of S&D, even for industries that have become internationally competitive.
It is hard to argue that all developing countries should enjoy the indefinite privilege of opting out of the WTO’s general obligations for all sectors of their economies.
And with so many of their WTO partners claiming preferential status, developed-country members often resist trade concessions within the organization, preferring to conduct negotiations in other forums.
The dynamic in the WTO stands in stark contrast to that within the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
At the WTO, developed countries would like to see big emerging markets take on more obligations, while developing countries resist.
At the Bretton Woods institutions, developed countries are blocking emerging economies from gaining greater influence.
But the two dynamics have something in common: intransigence, even if coming from different quarters, reflects a denial of reality.
In the Bretton Woods institutions, the emerging economies are right that their increased economic weight should correlate with larger capital contributions and more weight in decision-making.
In the WTO, S&D clearly needs to be updated to ensure that it benefits only countries that actually need it.
Ministers at the conference in Buenos Aires should thus be prepared to have an honest discussion about S&D.
A second topic that the WTO needs to address relates to consensus-building.
Under current WTO rules, most decisions can be adopted by a majority vote.
But the long-standing practice has been to adopt all decisions by consensus.
This is wise and should not change.
Though consensus-building can be slow and cumbersome, it is the only way to generate the legitimacy that WTO decisions need.
A simple majority vote, after all, would fail to account for differences in market size.
And weighted voting would undermine the WTO’s capacity to settle disputes by adjudicating rights and obligations among members of different size and political heft.
The problem is that consensus is interpreted as an unlimited veto power, such that a member can block any discussion on matters of interest to others.
A consensus-based approach can work only if it entails an obligation by all members to work toward shared interests, with members objecting formally only to decisions running counter to some fundamental interest.
The Paris climate agreement was made possible by a simple method called “Indaba,” adopted from the Zulu and Xhosa people of South Africa.
Negotiators had the right to withhold consent, but only if they put forth alternate proposals aimed at finding common ground.
If Indaba worked in Paris, it could also work at the WTO.
In Buenos Aires, ministers should discuss how to ensure that WTO members responsibly exercise their right to block decisions.
The final issue that ministers should be prepared to discuss in Buenos Aires is the need to ensure that the WTO adapts effectively to a changing international environment.
The problems with both S&D and consensus decision-making at the WTO are not new, but they have long been ignored, allowing them to deepen.
This would not have happened if incremental reform was ingrained in the WTO’s regular activities.
Both the IMF and the World Bank have policy watchdogs that regularly scrutinize and evaluate their functioning.
Running on very small budgets, these ruthless truth-tellers regularly force their institutions’ leaders to have honest discussions about organizational effectiveness and possible reforms.
Such an independent office for evaluation is precisely what the WTO needs.
The WTO cannot sweep its problems under the carpet forever.
The question is whether it will undertake the reforms it needs now or wait until a costly crisis leaves it no choice.

The WTO Reborn?
NEW DELHI – For too long, the World Trade Organization has languished, to lift a reference from T.S. Eliot, by the “waters of Leman” (Lake Geneva).
Once the world’s preeminent multilateral trade forum, the WTO has been steadily marginalized in recent years, and recent rebukes of globalization, such as the United Kingdom’s Brexit vote and the election of Donald Trump as US president, suggest that this trend will accelerate.
But these outcomes may actually have the opposite effect, owing to three key developments that could enable the revival of the WTO – and of the multilateralism that it embodies.
The first development is the decline of alternative trade arrangements.
The WTO reached its peak in the early 2000s, a few years after the Uruguay Round of global trade negotiations concluded, and a time when more countries – most notably China – were acceding to the organization.
But major trade players like the United States and the European Union subsequently shifted their focus from multilateral trade agreements to bilateral, regional, and mega-regional deals.
The mega-regionals – namely, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) – posed a particularly grave threat to the WTO.
Yet those are precisely the deals that the Trump administration is rejecting, or at least postponing.
European integration had a similar impact on the WTO, as it provided an alternative platform for managing intra-European trade.
But the European project has fallen on hard times, the most salient sign being the UK’s impending departure from the EU.
After Brexit, the WTO will probably become an important forum for Britain’s trade relations with the world. Any further disintegration of the EU will only bolster that trend.
Of course, it is possible that regional trade agreements in Asia and elsewhere will continue to flourish.
But new leadership would have to emerge. And no single systemically important country today meets the rigorous requirements of such leadership: internal political stability, economic dynamism, relatively contained risk, and a steadfast commitment to open markets.
However counterintuitive that may sound, a second development that bodes well for the WTO’s revival is voters’ increasing rejection of hyper-globalization.
Hyper-globalization is essentially “deep” integration. It goes beyond creating open markets for goods and services to include increased immigration (in the US and Europe), harmonizing regulations (the ambition of the TPP and the TTIP), and intrusive adjudication of domestic policies (the investor-settlement procedures under NAFTA and the TPP).
In the EU’s case, it even entails a common currency.
For such integration, regionalism is much more effective than the WTO.
Now that “deep” is out, the WTO could once again become an attractive forum for trading countries to do business.
Make no mistake: there will still be a lot of globalization for the WTO to facilitate and manage, not least because of the inexorable march of technology.
The mesh-like structure of trade and investment connecting countries, embodied in global value-chains – what Aaditya Mattoo of the World Bank and I have called “criss-crossing globalization” – will prevent significant backsliding.
The third development that could reinvigorate the WTO is a more protectionist stance by the Trump administration.
If the US raises tariffs or implements a border-adjustment tax favoring exports and penalizing imports, its trade partners are likely to turn to the WTO for adjudication, given the organization’s demonstrated dispute-settlement capability.
The WTO could, therefore, become the place where US trade policies are scrutinized and kept in check.
The universality of WTO membership, previously seen as an impediment to countries eager to move ahead with new rules and agreements, could be its main strength, as it implies a high degree of legitimacy, which is essential to minimize trade tensions and the risk of conflict.
In my book Eclipse, I argued that multilateralism offered the best means for ensuring the peaceful rise of new powers.
But it seems that the same argument could apply equally well to the management of receding powers.
But the WTO’s revival will not happen automatically. Willing stakeholders must actively pursue it.
The most obvious candidates for the job are the mid-size economies that have been the greatest beneficiary of globalization, and that, unlike the US and some European countries, are not currently under pressure from a globalization-averse public.
The champions of multilateralism should include Australia, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and possibly China and Japan.
Because none of them is large (with the exception of China), they must work collectively to defend open markets.
Moreover, they must open their own markets not only in the traditional areas of agriculture and manufacturing, but also in new areas such as services, investments, and standards.
In doing so, these countries would also be responding to the increasingly transactional approach to sustaining openness that the larger traders are being compelled to adopt.
The world needs a robust response to the decline of hyper-globalization.
Multilateralism, championed by mid-size trading economies with a strong interest in preserving openness, may be it.
To the shores of Leman they must now head.

The Lost Lessons of World War I
PARIS – It has been 100 years since World War I ended, and the centenary was commemorated this month with great pomp in Australia, Canada, France, and the United Kingdom.
Germany sent high-level authorities to France to mark the occasion, reaffirming the reconciliation between the two countries.
But the fact that Franco-German reconciliation did not occur until Europe had suffered another devastating war demonstrates how fragile peace can be, especially when political leaders are as shortsighted as they often are.
The Cambridge historian Christopher Clark aptly titled his 2012 book on the origins of WWI The Sleepwalkers.
Through a combination of willful blindness, utter complacency, and intense stubbornness, Europe’s leaders subjected their countries to a conflict that shattered an entire generation.
By the time WWI erupted, it should have been clear that industrialization and the transportation revolution had transformed warfare.
The Crimean War of 1853-1856 had over one million casualties; the American Civil War of 1861-1865 resulted in over 600,000 deaths.
Despite these experiences, Europe’s leaders clung to the nineteenth-century military theorist Carl von Clausewitz’s dictum that, “War is the continuation of politics through other means.”
So politics continued in the form of war, resulting in 20 million military and civilian casualties.
Yet not even that was enough to wake up the sleepwalkers.
In the years following the Armistice, Europe’s leaders failed to transcend the divisions that WWI had laid bare, with the tensions between the French and Germans being particularly destabilizing.
This failure was reflected in the Armistice itself, which imposed excessively harsh requirements on Germany, including billions of dollars in reparations payments, due at a time when the country faced a deep economic crisis.
Meanwhile, international oversight was too weak, with the League of Nations remaining largely silent in the face of dangerous developments, such as Adolf Hitler’s remilitarization of the Rhineland.
The US Senate’s rejection of the League of Nations in 1919 – and thus of the principles of internationalism and multilateralism that President Woodrow Wilson had promoted – certainly didn’t help matters.
More fundamentally, WWII erupted because nationalism was allowed to continue to fester.
French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau, for one, remained deeply nationalistic and, in particular, vehemently anti-German.
But while behaving like Clemenceau might win the war (especially if a power like the United States shows up to offer crucial help), it cannot win the peace; hard nationalism naturally leads to conflict.
Yet, today, a major world leader, US President Donald Trump, is behaving very much like Clemenceau.
This holds serious implications not just for the US, but also for Europe.
To be sure, French President Emmanuel Macron embraces the “Wilsonian principles” that Trump rejects.
But, as the interwar period starkly showed, if core rules and principles are not accepted by all, the institutions they underpin cannot be sustained.
WWII accomplished what even WWI could not: it ended the era of European global dominance.
While Europe has grown and prospered since 1945, it has not regained the global leadership status its major countries once possessed.
This leaves today’s European Union at the mercy of a US that has rejected multilateralism and embraced nationalism.
Of course, plenty of the risks Europe faces lie within its own borders.
In France, for example, many are brushing off the warnings issued by Macron – or, more concretely, by their history books – as they push back against their president’s efforts to take up the mantle of multilateralism.
The risk today is that generations that have not known war will reproduce the chain of events that lead to it.
This risk is exemplified by the recent “yellow vest” protests in France against an environmental tax on fuel.
The protests were also intended to be a broader rebuke of Macron, whom many blame for their declining spending power.
The protesters probably think that they are acting in the spirit of the 1789 French Revolution, a spirit that the French periodically revive in their country’s politics.
But they are actually reenacting the 1930s, with its right-wing protest movements and militias.
This is not to say that French citizens – and, in particular, young people – have nothing about which to complain.
Unemployment has remained too high for too long, and while France has largely escaped the spike in income inequality seen in other countries, such as the US, systemic inequalities are pervasive.
But the fact is that the emotional rejection of any person or institution even remotely associated with established “elites” – including mainstream political parties and trade unions – lends itself to exploitation by populist demagogues.
And history could not be clearer about the risks generated when such demagogues secure power.
The world has changed profoundly over the last century.
Our economies are more deeply intertwined than ever before, and the sheer scale of destruction that could be wrought by today’s weaponry may invite some semblance of restraint.
But, as Trump’s erratic presidency – including his challenges to longstanding alliances and reckless nuclear posturing – starkly demonstrates, the structures we have created to preserve peace are far from foolproof.
With populations across the West embracing nationalistic and populist ideas, we are again dancing on the rim of a volcano.

Putin on Parade
NEW YORK – This May’s parade in Moscow to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II promises to be the greatest Victory Day celebration since the Soviet Union’s collapse.
Some 16,000 soldiers, 200 armored vehicles, and 150 planes and helicopters are set to pass through and over Red Square.
It will be a scene that would easily have been familiar to Soviet leaders like Leonid Brezhnev and Nikita Khrushchev, taking the salute atop Lenin’s tomb.
Yet, though Russia’s WWII allies were from Europe and North America, no Western leaders will attend the commemoration – a reflection of the West’s disapproval of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea.
Instead, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s high-profile guests will include the leaders of China, India, and North Korea, underscoring just how few friends Russia has these days.
The surreal nature of this gathering reflects the increasingly bizarre nature of Putin’s regime.
Indeed, watching Russia nowadays is like watching the last installment of the X-Men film franchise, “Days of Future Past.”
Just as the X-Men in that film join forces with their younger selves to save mankind’s future, today’s Kremlin is harking back to Russia’s Soviet past in what it sees as a contemporary fight for the country’s survival.
Critical to this strategy is propaganda conflating the West today with the Germans who invaded Russia in 1941, while painting Ukrainian government officials as “fascists” and “neo-Nazis.”
The Kremlin has relied on such claims, together with the supposed need to defend Russians abroad, to justify its aggression against Ukraine.
In Putin’s speech following the annexation of Crimea, he charged that the West’s refusal “to engage in dialogue” left Russia with no choice.
“We are constantly proposing cooperation on all key issues,” he declared.
“We want to strengthen our level of trust and for our relations to be equal, open, and fair.
But we saw no reciprocal steps.”
A month later, Putin reinforced this image of Russians as the morally superior victims of a cruel and uncompromising West.
“We are less pragmatic than other people, less calculating,” he asserted, before adding that Russia’s “greatness” and “vast size” means “we have a more generous heart.”
It is not difficult to see the parallels between Putin’s approach and that of Joseph Stalin, who declared at the start of WWII that the “enemy” aims to “destroy” Russia’s “national culture,” to “Germanize” its people, and “convert them into slaves.”
The difference, of course, is that the Nazi Wehrmacht actually invaded the Soviet Union, whereas Ukraine simply wanted to decide its own future.
Without defending Stalin, one must recognize the immense Soviet contribution – including the lives of 26 million citizens – to the Allied victory in WWII.
At the time, the military parade in Red Square – featuring almost 35,000 troops, up to 1,900 pieces of military equipment, and a 1,400-man orchestra – was a well-deserved pageant.
The Soviet leadership spared no cost in staging its military displays, which, in the absence of an external military threat, became an important vehicle for rallying national unity.
After the Soviet Union’s collapse, Russia, no longer a superpower, put its military spectacles on ice.
But in 2005, to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of WWII, Putin held a major parade – one that Western leaders, believing that Russia might have a European future, did attend.
The tone of this year’s Victory Day commemorations is far less anticipatory.
How can one celebrate the end of a war at a time when the descendants of those who fought it (undoubtedly driven by the hope that future generations would live in peace) are killing one another in a brutal little war in eastern Ukraine?
What is the point of grandiose fireworks displays amid the firing of real howitzers and rockets?
The historian Robert Paxton believed that one could tell much about a country by its parades.
His 1966 book Parades and Politics at Vichy describes how Philippe Pétain, as Chief of State of Vichy France, used pageantry, reactionary politics, and, of course, a partnership with Adolf Hitler to dupe his defeated country into believing that it still mattered in the world.
The Vichy state’s brand of authoritarian traditionalism lionized family and fatherland, with Pétain, a former military commander, serving as a kind of military king, exalted on the tribune.
The parallels with Putin’s Russia are clear. Putin views himself as a new czar.
His KGB background dictates his leadership style, which includes the abolition of free and fair elections, the persecution of opponents, and the promotion of conservative values that he, like Pétain before him, juxtaposes with the corrupting influence of an “immoral” and “decadent” West.
Relying on this approach, Putin has built alliances with the likes of Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad and Egypt’s military ruler Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.
China, the world’s second largest economy, is a useful addition to this collection of friendly anti-democratic states, as it has its own strategic grievances with the West.
Unlike China, however, Russia is not a rising superpower.
Putin may try to portray his actions in Ukraine as a fight against fascism. But it is really a fight for relevance – a fight he will never win.
No matter how grand the parade, he cannot hide the truth: Russia’s days as a superpower are in the past. Putin’s patriotism, like Pétain’s, is that of the vanquished.

Xi’s Strong Hand Against Trump
LONDON – The world will soon witness a historic test of wills between China and the United States, two superpowers whose leaders see themselves as supreme.
In the immediate sense, it will be a battle over trade.
But also at stake is the strategic leadership of East Asia and, eventually, the international order.
As things stand, China holds a stronger position than many people realize.
The question is whether Chinese President Xi Jinping will feel confident or brazen enough to want to prove it.
The test of wills was hardly China’s choice; but nor does it come as a surprise.
US President Donald Trump’s recently announced import tariffs on steel, aluminum, and other Chinese-made goods are in keeping with his brand of economic nationalism.
And his decision to accept North Korea’s invitation to hold bilateral talks on its nuclear program reflects the same “bring it on” attitude that he applied to the North’s earlier threats of war.
The upcoming test will be historic because it promises to reveal the true strengths and attitudes of the world’s rising power vis-à-vis the weakened but still leading incumbent power.
For better or worse, the result could shape the world for decades to come.
On the trade front, China’s large bilateral surplus with the US could mean that it has more to lose from a trade war, simply because it has more exports that can be penalized.
It is often said that surplus countries will always be the biggest losers in any tit-for-tat escalation of tariffs and other barriers.
But this assumption misses multiple points.
For one thing, China is more economically resilient to the effects of a trade war than it used to be.
Trade as a share of its total economic activity has halved in the past decade, from more than 60% of GDP in 2007 to just over 30% today.
China also has major advantages in terms of domestic politics and international diplomacy.
As a dictatorship, China can ignore protests by workers and companies suffering from US tariffs.
In the US, where mid-term congressional elections will be held this November, the outcry from exporters, importers, and consumers facing higher costs will be heard loud and clear.
Of course, Trump, too, might ignore protests against his trade war if he is convinced that taking on China will please his core voters and win him re-election in 2020.
But congressional Republicans will probably feel differently, especially if their states or districts are among those being singled out by Chinese import tariffs.
In terms of international diplomacy, Trump’s trade war will help China present itself as the defender of the rules-based international order and multilateral institutions such as the World Trade Organization.
To be sure, not all countries would follow China’s lead.
The WTO does not recognize China as a market economy, owing to the Chinese government’s significant involvement in industry and alleged theft of intellectual property.
But China will have a chance to play the victim, while arguing that the US now poses the single largest threat to the global trading system that it helped create.
And if a US-initiated trade war drags on, China’s case will become only stronger as more countries suffer the disruptive effects of tariffs.
Of course, China may choose not to fight Trump’s trade war at all.
With symbolic concessions – such as an agreement to import US-produced liquefied natural gas or promises to offer new guarantees for intellectual-property rights – it could convince Trump to stand down.
But if Xi suspects that a show of strength will bolster China’s international standing while undercutting that of the US, he may decide to act accordingly.
The North Korea issue is more complicated.
But here, too, China will have an advantage.
Even barring real progress in the talks, China already looks like a good global citizen.
Over the past year, it has been pressuring the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, to negotiate.
By participating in coordinated economic sanctions against the Kim regime, and by reportedly capping vital exports of oil and other essentials to the North, China has played its part in bringing Kim to the table.
On paper, the fundamental question is whether North Korea will be willing to abandon its nuclear-weapons program, the fruit of more than 30 years of work.
And as China well knows, North Korea would never give up its nuclear weapons without major changes in the military balance on and around the Korean Peninsula.
Kim will likely offer to denuclearize solely on the condition that the US withdraw its forces from South Korea, and perhaps from Japan, too.
Barring that, he would not feel secure enough to do without the nuclear deterrence on which he has staked his regime’s survival.
For his part, Trump could not possibly accede to such a condition.
At best, he could agree on a process through which such extraordinary moves might be discussed at a later date.
Either way, China comes out on top.
In the event of stalemate, it will have gotten Kim to the table and put America in the position of being a refusenik.
And if the US does agree to any military concessions, China’s strategic position will be strengthened.
The only real question for Xi, then, is whether he wants to assert China’s top-dog status now, or sometime in the future.

The World According to Xi
BEIJING – On November 15 Xi Jinping became General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman of the CCP’s Central Military Commission, giving him supreme authority over China’s armed forces.
Next March, he will become President of China as well.
How does China’s new leader see the world, and how will he handle the country’s foreign policy?
Do his style and preferences differ significantly from those of his predecessor, Hu Jintao?
The answers will determine China’s relations with the world, and vice versa, for the next decade.
China’s leaders approach power in a very different way than do political leaders in, say, the United States.
American politicians must sell their ideas and values to voters; China’s leaders do not need to inform the press and the public directly about anything, including their foreign-policy positions.
Indeed, with the notable exceptions of Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, China’s leaders have seldom imposed their own personalities upon Chinese diplomacy.
In this sense, Xi’s leadership style will most likely continue in the tradition of his predecessors.
Nevertheless, Xi’s outlook and worldview are surely different from Hu’s.
For starters, Xi is part of a generation raised and educated mostly in China’s reform era, which has been a decisive influence in their lives.
China opened itself to the world in 1978, when Xi and his contemporaries were young men eager to understand the world outside China.
They are a generation inspired by Deng’s realistic approach to shattering the walls that radical leftists had built around China, and one that believes that knowledge can change the destiny of the country and its people.
When this generation assumes the mantle of leadership, its members will turn their passion and curiosity about knowledge and innovation into real work.
They are surely willing to learn from the wider world as they seek to promote China’s national interests abroad and encourage gradual change at home.
Xi may address Chinese diplomacy’s thorniest issues – particularly Sino-US relations – with more realism and flexibility than in recent years.
His visit to the US in February 2012 was widely regarded as a sequel to Deng’s visit in January 1979.
Xi talked to President Barack Obama and visited the Pentagon.
He gave a luncheon speech and saw old friends from his brief stay in Iowa as a young man.
He showed interest in American culture, just as Deng did in 1979.
He ate chocolate and watched NBA games.
Most important, instead of spending countless hours drearily discussing political and strategic topics, he spoke directly and vigorously about the current state of Sino-US relations.
“The Pacific Ocean is wide enough to accommodate the two major countries of China and the US,” he declared.
Unhappy with America’s “pivot” to Asia, Xi remained calm, but emphasized that “one cannot rely too much on military power regarding Asia-Pacific diplomacy.”
Similarly, Xi tried to avoid major arguments on human rights, saying simply, “There’s no best, only better.”
In essence, he sought to demonstrate that however many questions, arguments, and even potential conflicts exist between China and the US, both countries’ leaders should address them with an attitude of cooperation and sincerity.
Leaders should not become entangled in details that fuel suspicion of their counterparts’ motives, lest they lose sight of the bigger picture.
Xi’s confidence extends to China’s domestic politics.
His generation is more certain of reform than previous leadership cohorts were, owing less to official ideology than to the country’s enormous achievements in the last three decades.
In practice, Xi may well prove to be a nationalist; certainly, his generation, like the founding fathers of the People’s Republic, dreams of turning China into a stronger, more prosperous country.
The country’s new leaders want the world’s applause, but they are more eager for domestic ovations.
Like previous Chinese leaders, Xi firmly believes that the world should respect China’s authority to manage its own affairs.
Thus, he is willing to show diplomatic muscle if China is challenged on a core area of concern.
His speech in Mexico in 2009 demonstrated this.
“Some foreigners with full bellies and nothing better to do engage in finger-pointing at us,” he said.
“First, China does not export revolution; second, it does not export famine and poverty; and, third, it does not mess around with you.
So what else is there to say?”
Xi understands that the world expects not only a better China, but also a China that is committed to constructing a better world.
He will be a tough and strong-minded leader, but one who understands the world in a pragmatic way and knows how to work well with his foreign counterparts.
Indeed, his 2012 visit to the US left two impressions.
First, he is a leader at ease both in front of and away from the television cameras.
Second, he is not afraid to have a little fun.
With those simple touches of humanity, Xi could bring a revolution to China’s diplomacy.

China’s Dream World
CLAREMONT, CALIFORNIA – Ruling elites almost everywhere – whether in democracies or in authoritarian regimes – believe that clever sloganeering can inspire their people and legitimize their power.
There are, of course, crucial differences.
In functioning democracies, government leaders can be held accountable for their promises: the press can scrutinize their policies, opposition parties are motivated to show that the party in power lies and cheats.
As a result, incumbents are frequently forced to carry out at least some of their promises.
Autocratic rulers, by contrast, face no such pressures.
Press censorship, repression of dissent, and the absence of organized opposition allow rulers the luxury of promising whatever they want, with no political consequences for failing to deliver.
The result is government of the sloganeers, by the sloganeers, and for the sloganeers.
China appears to have perfected this form of government over the last decade.
The ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP), in response to rising public demand for social justice, has devised numerous slogans, such as “governing for the people,” “building a harmonious society,” “balanced development,” “scientific development,” and so on.
Whenever the top leadership in Beijing uttered such slogans, they became the rallying cry of the bureaucracy.
The party’s massive propaganda machine went into overdrive and blanketed the country with a publicity blitz that would make the most extravagant Madison Avenue advertising campaign look like child’s play.
But government by slogan, whether in China or in other autocracies, seldom achieves its declared goals.
In the last decade, GDP growth soared, but most indices of social justice, governance performance, and public welfare deteriorated.
Macroeconomic imbalances worsened as economic growth became excessively dependent on investment and exports.
Inequality worsened.
Official corruption escalated.
Social mobility declined.
Environmental degradation reached a crisis point.
Today, it is the responsibility of China’s new leadership, headed by President Xi Jinping, to avert another decade of missed opportunities.
Without missing a beat, Xi, like his predecessors, rolled out a new slogan to inspire popular confidence in his leadership.
As a catchphrase for his administration’s objective, “the great renaissance of the Chinese nation” is bit long, but it has lately morphed into the simpler “China Dream.”
The substance of the China Dream remains difficult to determine.
When Xi first unveiled his slogan after being selected as the CCP’s new general secretary, he defined it in simple, accessible, but nonetheless generic terms: The “Chinese people dream of living the same good life as all other people in the world.”
Xi has said little about the China Dream since – and his silence has caused considerable trouble.
China’s ever-zealous propaganda officials, evidently fearful of not demonstrating sufficient loyalty and respect for the new party chief, quickly hijacked the slogan; the China Dream has replaced the “China Model” in official political branding.
Whatever the new administration does is touted as part of its ambitious effort to make the “China Dream” come true.
Unfortunately, China propagandists, who double as censors, have a perverse ability to discredit anything that they try to brand.
The China Dream is no exception.
So far, public reaction has ranged from puzzlement to derision.
After a decade of government by slogan, the Chinese public wants substance.
This presents Xi with a real challenge.
He has risen to the top by winning friends and allies inside the CCP.
Now that he is the leader of a dynamic, diverse, and increasingly demanding society, he must gain popular support and confidence to maintain his credibility and become an effective politician.
The first thing that Xi should do is to articulate a clearer, more specific, and inspiring version of the China Dream, and stop letting the CCP’s propaganda officials define it for him.
The China Dream may include all of the economic benefits and material comfort that ordinary Chinese desire, but it will not be complete without the human rights and dignity that citizens in civilized societies take for granted.
The second thing that Xi and his colleagues need to do is to follow up with specific policies and actions that can bolster the credibility of their declared goals.
Political slogans, however high-sounding, become stale when their purveyors fail to make good on their promises.
Xi may still be enjoying a honeymoon with the Chinese public, but it is likely to be a short one.
His predecessors had ten years to carry out real reforms and accomplished little, leaving the Chinese in no mood to endure another decade of government by shibboleth.

Will China Weaponize Social Media?
ATLANTA – Ever since the 2016 US presidential election, with its revelations about Russian meddling, European officials have been on the lookout for similar attacks. But Europeans aren’t the only ones paying attention.
So, too, are China’s leaders, who are considering what they might learn from the Kremlin’s successes.
For Chinese President Xi Jinping, maintaining domestic stability is a top priority, a point underscored by China’s annual budget for internal security.
At well over $100 billion, the official number is low.
Like defense outlays, the real number is much higher, owing to hidden spending, including on research and development.
For example, China is exploring how artificial intelligence (AI) and big data can be used to monitor everything from social media to credit-card spending, and it plans to assign all citizens a social-reliability rating to weed out potential troublemakers.
The regime’s Orwellian strategy is focused squarely on social media and controlling not just what is said, but also how information flows into and around the country.
Moreover, the authorities are bringing technology companies into line with tough new laws and cyber-security investigations.
For Xi, the ease with which the Kremlin has manipulated Facebook and Twitter demonstrates the need for a tighter grip on China’s own social-media platforms.
The Chinese government is now requesting seats on the boards of companies such as WeChat, Weibo, and Tencent, and demanding access to their users’ personal data.
Chinese cyber spies are also studying Russia’s success. To be sure, Chinese hackers do not lack technical savvy.
They have launched cyberattacks against US presidential campaigns, expatriate Tibetan movements, and Uighur activists. They have burrowed into Western think tanks and universities that study China.
They have even hacked into Western news outlets that published embarrassing stories about Chinese leaders’ wealth.
Still, the Chinese may have something to learn from Russia’s well-choreographed online army of trolls and bots.
Similarly, strategists at the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) are likely poring over the Kremlin’s handiwork to inform their own cyber-war tactics.
Chinese strategic thinking about “political warfare” holds that an adversary’s political, social, and economic institutions – particularly the media – should be targeted before a shooting war ever begins.
To that end, Russia’s diffusion of bogus news and conspiracy theories through its state-funded media outlets RT and Sputnik could prove instructive.
In addition to expanding China’s cyber capabilities, Xi has also been developing China’s soft power through economic, social, cultural, and media initiatives.
And although he has not yet coupled these programs with China’s clandestine forces to launch the kind of audacious attack that roiled the 2016 presidential election, he clearly is establishing the means to do so.
Recently, it was revealed that China has been conducting wide-ranging influence operations in Australia, using official campus organizations to monitor Chinese college students, business associations to tout Chinese interests, and diplomats to police local Chinese-language media.
Late last year, an Australian senator was forced to resign over his alleged ties to a Chinese billionaire.
China is also expanding its global media presence.
By some estimates, the government is sinking some $7 billion into new media and broadcast outlets abroad every year.
Its official news agency, Xinhua, has more than 170 bureaus around the world and publishes in eight languages.
China Central Television (CCTV) has more than 70 foreign bureaus and broadcasts to 171 countries in six languages.
China Radio International is the world’s second-largest radio broadcaster after the BBC, broadcasting in 64 languages from 32 foreign bureaus to 90 radio stations worldwide.
None of these organizations has yet to distinguish itself as a go-to international news source. But they have become a significant source of information for people in underserved regions such as the Middle East and Africa, where they purvey China’s views and are building sympathetic audiences.
At the same time, China is purchasing “native advertising” in Australian, American, and European newspapers. This allows China to place officially authored content about controversial issues – such as its militarized island-building in the South China Sea – next to those publications’ editorial offerings.
Xi is also playing the long game, by approving investments in movies and other forms of mass entertainment to influence how global popular culture treats all things Chinese.
Despite the Chinese government’s recent clampdown on outbound capital flows, Chinese companies are still adding to their major stakes in Hollywood properties.
The Chinese conglomerate Dalien Wanda alone has some $10 billion in entertainment assets in the United States, Europe, and Australia.
And other Chinese Internet and financial giants such as Alibaba, Tencent, and Hony Capital, as well as state-owned companies such as the China Film Group, have invested tens of billions of dollars in US film ventures.
With these financial stakes, the Chinese government has leverage that goes beyond old-fashioned censorship.
Hollywood studio bosses with an eye on China’s massive domestic market will be tempted to kowtow to the government’s “creative” requests when it comes to scripts, casting decisions, and so forth.
At $8.6 billion in 2017, Chinese box-office receipts are second only to North America’s.
Yet China allows only 38 foreign films into the country each year, inducing filmmakers to bend over backward to please the censors.
Of course, Hollywood executives aren’t the only Westerners helping Xi’s realize his agenda.
Between Apple’s recent decision to relinquish its Chinese user data storage to a Chinese partner and Google’s announcement that it will site a new AI research center in China, US technology giants are not just making deals to benefit their “stakeholders.”
They are also handing Xi and his cyber operatives proprietary technologies and know-how, and even potential access to US targets.
This raises an obvious question: If Russia could roil a US presidential election without such intimate business relationships, what will China be able to do in the years ahead?
To think that China’s only interest is making money, one Hollywood executive recently acknowledged, would be “very naive and dangerous” indeed.

Xi Jinping’s Vision for Global Governance
NEW YORK – The contrast between the disarray in the West, on open display at the NATO summit and at last month’s G7 meeting in Canada, and China’s mounting international self-confidence is growing clearer by the day.
Last month, the Communist Party of China (CPC) concluded its Central Conference on Work Relating to Foreign Affairs, the second since Xi Jinping became China’s undisputed ruler in 2012.
These meetings are not everyday affairs. They are the clearest expression of how the leadership sees China’s place in the world, but they tell the world much about China as well.
The last such conference, in 2014, marked the funeral of Deng Xiaoping’s dictum of “hide your strength, bide your time, never take the lead,” and heralded a new era of international activism.
In part, this change reflected Xi’s centralization of control, Chinese leaders’ conclusion that American power is in relative decline, and their view that China had become an indispensable global economic player.
Since 2014, China has expanded and consolidated its military position in the South China Sea. It took the idea of the New Silk Road and turned it into a multi-trillion-dollar trade, investment, infrastructure, and wider geopolitical/geo-economic initiative, engaging 73 different countries across much of Eurasia, Africa and beyond.
And China signed up most of the developed world to the first large-scale non-Bretton Woods multilateral development bank, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.
China has also launched diplomatic initiatives beyond its immediate sphere of strategic interest in East Asia, as well as actively participating in initiatives such as the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.
It has developed naval bases in Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Djibouti, and participates in naval exercises with Russia as far away as the Mediterranean and the Baltic.
In March, China established its own international development agency.
The emergence of a coherent grand strategy (regardless of whether the West chooses to recognize it as such) is not all that has changed since 2014.
For starters, the emphasis on the CPC’s role is much stronger than before.
Xi, concerned that the party had become marginal to the country’s major policy debates, has reasserted party control over state institutions and given precedence to political ideology over technocratic policymaking.
Xi is determined to defy the trend-line of Western history, to see off Francis Fukuyama’s “end of history” culminating in the general triumph of liberal democratic capitalism, and preserve a Leninist state for the long term.
This approach – known as “Xi Jinping Thought” – now suffuses China’s foreign policy framework.
In particular, Xi’s view that that there are identifiable immutable “laws” of historical development, both prescriptive and predictive, was particularly prominent at last month’s foreign policy conference.
If this sounds like old-fashioned dialectical materialism, that’s because it is.
Xi embraces the Marxist-Leninist tradition as his preferred intellectual framework.
Given its emphasis on iron laws of political and economic development, a dialectical-materialist worldview means that there is nothing random about world events.
So, Xi argues, if Marx’s analytical framework is applied to the current period, it is clear that the global order is at a turning point, with the West’s relative decline coinciding with the fortuitous national and international circumstances enabling China’s rise.
In Xi’s words, “China has been in the best period of development since modern times, while the world is undergoing the most profound and unprecedented changes in a century.”
Of course, formidable obstacles lie ahead for China.
But Xi has concluded that the obstacles facing the US and the West are greater.
How such thinking will now drive China’s concrete foreign policy is anyone’s guess.
But how one-party states, particularly Marxist states, choose to “ideate” reality matters a great deal: it is how the system speaks to itself.
And Xi’s message to China’s foreign policy elite is one of great confidence.
Specifically, the Central Conference called for the country’s international policy institutions and personnel to embrace Xi’s agenda.
Here Xi seems to have the foreign ministry in his sights.
There is a strong ideological flavor to Xi’s apparent frustration with the ministry’s glacial approach to policy innovation.
China’s diplomats were urged to bear in mind that they are first and foremost “party cadres,” suggesting that Xi is likely to push the foreign policy apparatus toward greater activism, to give full effect to his emerging global vision.
The biggest change to emerge from last month’s conference concerns global governance.
In 2014, Xi referred to an impending struggle for the future structure of the international order.
While he did not elaborate, much work has since been devoted to three inter-related concepts: guoji zhixu (the international order); guoji xitong (the international system), and quanqiu zhili (global governance).
Of course, these terms have different and overlapping meanings in English, too.
But, broadly speaking, in Chinese, the term “international order” refers to a combination of the United Nations, the Bretton Woods Institutions, the G20, and other multilateral institutions (which China accepts), as well as the US system of global alliances (which China does not).
The term “international system” tends to refer to the first half of this international order: the complex web of multilateral institutions that operate under international treaty law and seek to govern the global commons on the basis of the principle of shared sovereignty.
And “global governance” denotes the actual performance of the “international system” so defined.
What is startlingly new about Xi’s remarks at the Central Conference was his call for China now to “lead the reform of the global governance system with the concepts of fairness and justice.”
This is by far the most direct statement of China’s intentions on this important question offered so far.
The world should buckle up and get ready for a new wave of Chinese international policy activism.
Like much of the rest of the international community, China is acutely conscious of the dysfunctionality of much of the current multilateral system.
So Xi’s wish to lead “reform of the global governance system” is no accident. It reflects growing diplomatic activism in multilateral institutions, in order to reorient them in a direction more compatible with what China regards as its “core national interests.”
Xi has reminded China’s international policy elite that the totality of China’s future foreign policy direction, including the reform of global governance, must be driven by these core national interests.
In this context, China also wants a more “multipolar” international system.
This is code for a world in which the role of the United States and the West is substantially reduced.
The challenge for the rest of the international community is to define what type of global order we now want.
What do existing institutions like the European Union, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or the African Union want for the international rules-based system for the future?
What exactly does the US want, with or without Trump?
And how will we collectively preserve the global values embodied in the UN Charter, the Bretton Woods institutions, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights?
The future of the global order is in a state of flux.
China has a clear script for the future.
It’s time for the rest of the international community to develop one of its own.
This is an edited version of an address delivered to the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore.

Xi Jinping is No Mao Zedong
BEIJING – Much of the world is watching Chinese President Xi Jinping with concern.
Not only has he been re-concentrating power in the hands of the central government; many believe that his radical anti-corruption campaign is a fig leaf for a political purge.
They worry that Xi is building a cult of personality, much like the one that surrounded Mao Zedong and fueled the Cultural Revolution.
The truth is far less sinister.
While it is true that Xi is, to some extent, amassing power, his motivation is the need to strengthen China – both its government and its economy.
To succeed, he must bring a bureaucracy that has spun somewhat out of control back in line.
Over the last three decades, power in China has been decentralized considerably, with provincial and municipal governments receiving, in an incremental fashion, substantial autonomy to experiment and test reforms aimed at attracting foreign investment and spurring GDP growth.
Moreover, they have been granted direct control over resources – such as land, finance, energy, and raw materials – and local infrastructure development.
As a result, subnational governments accounted for an average of 71% of total public expenditure in 2000-2014 – a far larger share than in the world’s largest federal countries (US states’ share of public spending, for example, is 46%.)
The goal was to spur overall economic growth by encouraging competition among regions.
Local party bosses knew that their career paths depended on their municipalities’ economic performance. And by working hard to spur growth, they have fueled China’s rise to become the world’s second-largest economy (by some measures, the largest) and secured the ruling Communist Party’s legitimacy in the post-Mao era.
But decentralization has had its downsides.
It has led to substantial waste, exemplified in local governments’ massive debts. And it has spurred large-scale corruption, with local officials striking special deals with businesses to provide, say, tax breaks, cheap credit, or land at below-market prices.
In a country with stringent regulations and underdeveloped financial markets, private entrepreneurs face high barriers to starting and operating businesses.
If illicit deals are what it takes to gain access to the resources and markets they needed, private firms have been more than willing to strike them, offering cash or other payments to officials who bent or broke rules on their behalf.
Such arrangements facilitated the entry of hundreds of thousands of growth-enhancing private firms into the market in the late 1990s.
In an era when economic growth was the top priority, the corruption that fueled it was tacitly accepted, and even blithely condoned.
But corruption has spun out of control, and now threatens both China’s stability and the Communist Party’s legitimacy.
Over three decades of lax governance, some local authorities have formed political cliques that work together to protect their illicit gains and economic interests.
Embezzlement and misappropriation of astronomical sums of public funds would have been impossible without accomplices to provide protection and help one another ascend the political ladder.
These stealth political networks became virtually impenetrable, with many officials, by default, becoming the central government’s rivals, fiercely defending their economic interests by safeguarding their official posts and perquisites.
Unless it reined in the municipal satraps, the central government could essentially kiss its reform plans goodbye.
So Xi stopped turning a blind eye to corruption.
He put some local-government powers back into the hands of the central authorities. And he launched his far-reaching anti-corruption campaign.
Over the last two years, officials from all China’s provinces – ranging from low-ranking department chiefs in ministries to senior provincial leaders – have been incarcerated.
Geographical considerations have sometimes been taken into account, with the arrest of an official from a peripheral province followed by the arrest of one from a central municipality.
Rounding up a large number of senior officials (and military officers) who are perceived to be political rivals may look like a purge. But the fact is that all those who have been prosecuted and sentenced to prison terms were found guilty, based on hard evidence.
Present-day China, even with its imperfect judiciary, can no longer imprison officials purely on political grounds, as was the case under Mao.
Xi’s efforts to rein in China’s bureaucracy continues unabated.
In the short term, economic activity could suffer, as local authorities delay decisions, so as to avoid attracting too much attention to themselves. But once the system is cleaned up, China will be in a much stronger position to achieve sustainable and stable economic growth.
Those who fear Cultural Revolution 2.0 need to understand that China is not the country it was 50 years ago.
The soil for authoritarianism and a cult of personality has been plowed under by three decades of increasing openness and economic growth.
No one understands this better than Xi.

Xi of Arabia
BEIJING – Those who have criticized China’s cautious foreign policy need to reconsider their position, following President Xi Jinping’s just-completed visit to Saudi Arabia and Iran – two major Middle Eastern powers that are currently at each other’s throats.
The visits reflect the more active foreign-policy approach that Xi has spearheaded, particularly in the Middle East.
This new approach raises an important question: Can China’s impact on the region be more constructive than that of the United States?
Now is certainly a tense time to become involved in the Middle East, a region where, as Richard N. Haass argues, a New Thirty Years’ War, in which “civil wars and proxy wars become impossible to distinguish,” is unfolding.
A key factor in unleashing the current chaos – which represents the convergence of numerous deep-rooted challenges and conflicts – was America’s 2003 invasion of Iraq.
By eliminating Saddam Hussein’s Sunni regime, the US paved the way for a Shia-led government, a development that tilted the regional balance of power toward Iran and left Sunni-ruled Saudi Arabia feeling encircled by a Shia coalition.
That is why Iran and Saudi Arabia are so deeply involved in Syria’s civil war.
They know that the fate of President Bashar al-Assad’s Alawite regime will have significant implications for the regional order.
For Saudi Arabia, reining in Iran is all the more important in the wake of the recent agreement on the country’s nuclear program, which has resulted in the lifting of international economic sanctions that have long constrained Iran’s regional leadership ambitions.
Of course, neither Saudi Arabia nor Iran – or Turkey, which has also joined the competition for regional influence – is seeking a direct confrontation.
These countries would rather empower other actors, even if it means fueling dangerous religious radicalization and the privatization of violence.
The terrorist movements that have emerged as a result of this approach – namely, the Islamic State – cannot be defeated using traditional counter-terrorism operations.
To be sure, these Middle East rivals are not the only ones involved in the region’s current quagmire.
External powers like France, Russia, and, of course, the US are also deeply involved, each with its own geopolitical objectives.
Now China is entering the fray, bringing a uniquely constructive vision with it.
The two characters that comprise the Chinese word for crisis (危机) mean, individually, “danger” (危) and “opportunity” (机).
That is precisely what China sees in today’s Middle East.
For most of the relevant actors, highly perilous geopolitical competition is overshadowing vast economic opportunities.
Not for China.
As Xi put it on his recent visit to Cairo: “Instead of looking for a proxy in the Middle East, we promote peace talks; instead of seeking any sphere of influence, we call on all parties to join the circle of friends for the Belt and Road initiative.”
This reflects the broader foreign-policy rebalancing that Xi has been pursuing since taking office in 2013.
Unlike the US, which has been engineering a strategic “pivot” from one geographic region to another, China is rebalancing from “politics among nations” to “politics among networks,” focusing on “connectivity” rather than “control.”
The Middle East is crucial to this connectivity-oriented grand strategy, not least because of its key role in the “One Belt, One Road” project that Xi promoted in Cairo.
China’s determination to reestablish the ancient Silk Roads – including the overland route that runs through the Middle East – has led it to enter into strategic partnerships with eight Arab countries in recent years, and to sign agreements with six Arab countries to pursue the initiative jointly.
Iran, Turkey, and seven Arab countries are among the founding members of the Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a key institution for financing related infrastructure projects.
But China is not waiting for the One Belt, One Road initiative to be completed before pursuing increased trade with Middle Eastern countries.
During his recent visit to Saudi Arabia, he claimed that free-trade negotiations between the Gulf Cooperation Council and China should be concluded this year.
Moreover, Xi announced that China will issue $55 billion in loans to the Middle East, including a $15 billion special loan for industrialization, $10 billion in commercial loans to boost production capacity, and $10 billion in concessional loans.
The remaining $20 billion will go toward a joint investment fund with the United Arab Emirates and Qatar to invest in traditional energy, infrastructure development, and high-end manufacturing industries in the region.
All of this aligns with the “1+2+3” cooperation pattern that Xi proposed at the June 2014 Ministerial Conference of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum in Beijing.
According to this approach, energy cooperation should form the core of collaboration, while infrastructure construction and trade and investment form two wings. Nuclear power, satellites, and new energy sources are three high-tech areas where cooperation can lead to important breakthroughs.
Here, the goal is to take advantage of the region’s energy resources, while helping it to industrialize and diversify its economy.
Of course, China’s success in the Middle East requires progress on mitigating the region’s tensions, cooling its hotspots, and stabilizing weak countries – all of which will require smart diplomacy by many actors.
But peace and development are inextricably linked.
To turn the tide against extremism, Middle Eastern countries must be able to provide economic opportunities to their people, and these can only be secured through trade, investment, and jobs.
In this fundamental respect, China has a lot to offer the Middle East – and President Xi has once again shown his determination to offer it.

China’s Contradictions
NEW HAVEN – China’s quinquennial Communist Party congresses are that rare event where ritual and dogma combine with introspection and strategy.
The 19th National Congress, which began on October 18, is no exception.
Notwithstanding the suspense over potential changes in Party leadership, which typically occur at the end of the meeting, President Xi Jinping’s political report, delivered on the opening day, was a high-impact event.
Significantly, it says as much about the Party as it does about Xi.
As Alice Miller, a leading Sinologist at Stanford’s Hoover Institution, emphasizes, the report was carefully crafted over a one-year period to convey the consensus of the Party’s highest organ, the 205-member Central Committee.
Three conclusions from Xi’s address are particularly important.
For starters, the ideological underpinnings of “Xi Jinping Thought” have been raised to the same lofty level as those of “Mao Zedong Thought,” effectively elevating Xi over his three predecessors – Hu Jintao, Jiang Zemin, and even the revered Deng Xiaoping.
Much has been written about Xi’s consolidation of power since he was appointed General Secretary in November 2012. But this elevation makes it official.
After only five years in office, the Party leadership has anointed Xi as one of modern China’s two greatest historic figures.
Second, the political report speaks with great confidence about a China that has now entered a “New Era.”
But by underscoring the Chinese adage that the “…last leg of a journey just marks the halfway point,” Xi sketched an even more ambitious future.
China’s sights are now set on two goals – completing the task of building the so-called moderately prosperous society by 2035, and then establishing its position as a Great Power by 2050.
Unlike China’s goal-setting exercises in the past, there are no quantitative targets attached to these “twin centenary goals” (which roughly align with the Party’s founding in 1921 and the establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949).
They celebrate the long-awaited national rejuvenation that Xi has dubbed the China Dream.
The third point is perhaps the most intriguing. This is couched in the form of China’s “principal contradiction” – a Marxist concept that serves as an admission of a fundamental problem requiring resolution.
The principal contradiction, while typically elliptical and ambiguous, frames a rich discussion of risks and opportunities, strategy and tactics, reforms and governance – all of which will shape China’s prospects for the foreseeable future.
The big news is that, under Xi’s leadership, the Party has revised its principal contradiction for the first time since 1981.
Whereas the contradiction had previously been framed as a tradeoff between the needs of the people and China’s “backward social production,” it is now viewed as a tension between “unbalanced and inadequate development” and the “people’s ever-growing needs for a better life.”
This restatement of the principal contradiction has not emerged from thin air.
It clearly signals a far-reaching change in national perspective – from that of a poor developing country to that of an increasingly prosperous society focused on becoming a Great Power.
It is also consistent with the critique of former Premier Wen Jiabao, who in March 2007 famously warned of a Chinese economy that was becoming increasingly “unstable, unbalanced, uncoordinated, and [ultimately] unsustainable.”
Over the past ten years, two five-year plans – the 12th, enacted in 2011, and the 13th, enacted in 2016 – plus a major set of reforms adopted at the so-called Third Plenum in 2013, have aimed to resolve China’s persistent and worrisome imbalances. Xi’s political report doesn’t alter the main thrust of those efforts.
The real significance is that rebalancing is now enshrined within the Party’s ideological underpinnings. It is a foundational pillar of Xi Jinping Thought.
The political report’s focus on China’s principal contradiction also raises important questions about what still may be missing from the Party’s long-term strategy.
Three “secondary contradictions” are especially striking on the economic front.
First, there is ongoing tension between the role of the state and that of markets in guiding resource allocation. This was a glaring contradiction of the 2013 Third Plenum reforms, which focused on the seemingly inconsistent combination of a “decisive role” for markets and steadfast support for state ownership.
The Party has long believed that these two features of economic life are compatible – the so-called blended economy with Chinese characteristics.
Xi’s political report praises the mixed ownership model and also aspires to an economy led by great firms with unmatched global competitive prowess.
But it glosses over the thorny issue of state-owned enterprise reform that may be required to resolve this contradiction and avoid the Japanese “zombie” problem of a chronic debt overhang.
Second, there is the tension between supply and demand.
Consistent with other recent pronouncements of senior Chinese officials, the political report leaves little doubt that supply-side structural reforms are now the highest priority of economic policymakers.
The related emphasis on productivity, innovation, pruning excess capacity, and moving up the value chain in manufacturing and services are underscored as key building blocks of this effort.
At the same time, the report de-emphasizes consumer spending and services – now buried deep in the list of priorities for a modernized economy.
Yet focusing on supply without paying equal attention to the foundations of aggregate demand is a puzzling and potentially worrisome disconnect.
A final secondary tension can be found in the contrast between the path and the destination.
Notwithstanding all the self-congratulatory flourishes in Xi’s political report, there is good reason to believe that the Chinese economy is only in the early stages of its long-heralded structural transformation.
Its services sector is growing rapidly, but is still embryonic, accounting for just 52% of GDP.
And household consumption, which is also growing rapidly, is still less than 40% of GDP.
China may well be on a path to a New Normal or a New Era.
But the final destination remains far down the road, with many contradictions to be resolved during the journey.

China’s Big-Data Big Brother
LAHORE – The Communist Party of China’s (CPC) decision this week to eliminate presidential term limits seems to open the door for President Xi Jinping to be not just “Chairman of Everything,” but also “Chairman Forever.”
The move has been met with dismay around the world, but it has also intensified an ongoing debate among China experts over whether the biggest threat to China is too much executive power, or too little.
Where one stands on that question seems to depend largely on whether one is a political scientist, an economist, or a technologist.
Many political scientists and legal scholars, for example, argue against the change, because they consider the model of collective leadership that the CPC established after 1979 to be one of its biggest successes.
That model’s term limits and system of peer review for high-level decision-making has provided the checks necessary to prevent a repeat of Mao-era catastrophes such as the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution.
In fact, the post-1979 dispensation has often allowed for a genuine battle of ideas, particularly between the statist Young Communist League and coastal elites who favor more economic liberalization.
China may remain a closed society in many ways, but its top policymakers have shown an open-minded willingness to experiment and learn through trial and error.
Many economists, meanwhile, are less worried about excessive executive power, because they think it is even more dangerous to have a government that is too weak to overhaul the country’s economic model when needed.
Among the government’s current economic challenges are slower growth, spiraling debt – particularly among state-owned enterprises – and vested interests standing in the way of structural reforms.
Most economists would concede that the collective leadership model has prevented disasters.
But they would argue that it has also impeded reform, and allowed the CPC to become a syndicate of corruption and cronyism, ideologically bereft and devoid of purpose.
At the end of Hu Jintao’s two-term presidency in 2013 many feared that the collective leadership model was inadequate for confronting vested economic interests, tackling inequality, and delivering basic public goods.
Indeed, as early as 2007, Hu’s own premier, Wen Jiabao, had concluded that China’s economic trajectory was “unstable, unbalanced, uncoordinated, and unsustainable.”
By contrast, argue the economists, Xi has begun to turn things around by fighting for a “cleaner party.”
His massive anti-corruption campaign has jailed thousands of party officials at all levels, and reestablished the CPC’s grassroots credentials.
The economists would concede that Xi’s campaign has also conveniently removed many of his potential rivals.
But they would argue that his strengthened position now allows him to replace a growth model based on credit-financed debt with something more sustainable.
Of course, whether they are right about that remains to be seen.
Despite Xi’s success in consolidating his power and extending his hold on it indefinitely, there is reason to doubt that he would be willing to risk a new economic model if sustainability proves to be incompatible with maintaining rapid growth.
This is where the technologists come in, by offering new ways to correct or avoid potential mistakes.
In addition to supplanting the collective leadership model with one centered on the personality of a supreme leader, Xi has also significantly expanded the surveillance state.
The government is increasingly using CCTV, big data, and artificial intelligence to study Chinese citizens’ behaviors, hopes, fears, and faces, so that it can forestall dissidence and challenges to its authority.
Moreover, under Xi, the government has established online “social credit” databases, which suggests that it could eventually roll out a single score for all Chinese citizens, comprising credit ratings, online behavior, health records, expressions of party loyalty, and other information.
The beauty of a big-data dictatorship is that it could sustain itself less through direct threats and punishment as a public spectacle, and more through “nudges” to manipulate people’s perspectives and behavior.
And the more time Chinese citizens spend online, the more the government will be able to control what they see and do there.
Digital technologies will also allow the government to respond more quickly to public discontent, or to head it off altogether if it can discern or predict changes in public opinion.
Given that many dictatorships collapse as a result of poor information, digital technologies could become an even more powerful prophylactic against bad decision-making than term limits.
If there is one thing that political scientists, economists, and technologists can all agree on, it is that Xi is building the most powerful and intrusive surveillance regime in history.
It remains to be seen if his approach to “making China great again” will strengthen his hand or turn out to be a fatal weakness.
But with China playing an ever-larger role in the global economy through its investments and infrastructure projects, the reverberations from what happens there will be felt everywhere, and for years to come.
In a sense, Xi might just end up being a “chairman of everything forever” after all.

When Xi Meets Obama
CLAREMONT, CALIFORNIA – As Chinese President Xi Jinping begins his trip to the United States in Seattle, home to many of the world’s leading technology firms, most observers are looking ahead to his subsequent meeting with President Barack Obama.
Can the summit reverse the downward spiral in US-China relations that began with Xi’s accession to power in 2013?
Few dispute that the world’s most important bilateral relationship is in deep trouble.
From the US perspective, China’s reckless behavior in the South China Sea, unrestrained cyber attacks against American targets, protectionist economic policies, and escalating political repression at home have demolished the belief that a globally integrated China would be a responsible and cooperative partner.
Indeed, recent Chinese actions directly challenge vital American interests and core values.
Chinese leaders, for their part, view America’s strategic “pivot to Asia” as a thinly veiled step to tighten its geopolitical containment of China.
Moreover, they have become obsessed with US dominance in international finance and technology and, most important, America’s ideological commitment to liberal democracy, which they regard as an existential threat to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).
The toxic mix of mutual mistrust and tit-for-tat behavior has brought Sino-American ties to their lowest point since the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989.
There is now widespread concern that the US and China may be headed for a new cold war.
For Xi, the stakes of his US trip could not be higher.
To maintain his domestic image as a strong leader, he must stick to his nationalist rhetoric and policies.
But he also needs to stabilize the all-important relationship with the US.
Judging by recent moves by China and the US, we can expect modest success in a few contentious areas.
While such improvements, on their own, will not change the relationship’s adversarial dynamic, they may halt the deterioration in bilateral ties, at least for now.
On the eve of the summit, both the US and China took positive, albeit symbolic, steps to demonstrate their goodwill and improve the diplomatic atmosphere.
The US extradited a low-level Chinese official to face corruption charges.
The Obama administration also decided not to announce sanctions against Chinese entities and individuals allegedly involved in cyber attacks on American companies and government agencies.
For its part, China released a human-rights activist and dispatched a high-level delegation to the US to discuss cyber security.
In fact, the two sides are reportedly negotiating a landmark deal that would prohibit cyber attacks against each other’s vital infrastructure.
An agreement on the issue could be the most important outcome of the summit, although other types of cyber attacks are unlikely to be covered by it.
For China, the biggest prize is a bilateral investment treaty (BIT).
In practical terms, a US-China BIT would make it easier for Chinese entities to invest and operate in the US and increase American firms’ access to Chinese markets.
Such a deal would be a near-term boon for Xi, because it would represent a vote of confidence by the US in China’s struggling economy.
But the prospects for a BIT are uncertain, at best.
The US Congress is deeply skeptical, and the American business community needs convincing as well.
Both have been bitterly disappointed by China’s mercantilist trading policies after its accession to the World Trade Organization.
Given how many contentious issues remain unresolved, an accord is unlikely during the summit.
The South China Sea dispute may prove to be the toughest diplomatic nut to crack.
China has staked its national prestige and its leadership’s nationalist credentials on this issue, which means that Xi is likely to rebuff US demands that China cease all activities seen as militarizing its new artificial islands in disputed waters.
The most that can be realistically expected is an insipid statement of the two sides’ agreement to disagree.
But the most politically sensitive topic for China has little to do with cyber security or the South China Sea. It is China’s ongoing crackdown on civil liberties and human rights.
Facing enormous domestic pressure, Obama has announced that human rights will be on the agenda of his summit with Xi.
But Xi is unlikely to make any concessions, because doing so could damage his political standing within the CCP and undermine a central component of his political vision: the reassertion of political control over a dynamic society.
Ultimately, the key question looming over the summit is whether Xi will be able to offer enough to repair the damage done to Sino-US relations in recent years.
To be sure, trying is better than doing nothing.
But what really matters is whether, after the summit, China takes concrete actions that reflect a genuine shift from the policies that have fueled the deterioration in bilateral ties.

Yale’s Safe Sex Criminals
NEW YORK – In October 2010, the current brothers of George W. Bush’s former fraternity at Yale, Delta Kappa Epsilon, marched through the first-year quad chanting, “No means yes! Yes means anal!”
They held up signs reading, “We love Yale Sluts.”
Sixteen graduate and undergraduate students, male and female, felt that the university’s administration then did little to push back against such encroachments on female students’ rights to a fair and non-threatening learning environment.
In March, they filed a federal lawsuit against Yale, alleging that its “failure to address incidents of sexual harassment and sexual assault has created a ‘hostile environment.’”
The lawsuit did not stop with the DKE incident.
First-year women were ranked on their sex appeal, the complaint noted, and, most seriously, Yale failed to respond adequately to reports of sexual assault or attempted assault and stalking.
According to Alexandra Brodsky, a Yale junior and one of the 16 complainants, the students are “really frustrated and disappointed that Yale again and again fails to respond to both public and private acts of sexual harassment and assaults, which…perpetuates an environment in which these…acts are okay.”
The students’ complaint coincides with a federal investigation by the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, which announced that it would review Yale’s policies for dealing with sexual harassment and sexual assault.
This is no small matter: Yale and other American universities receive millions of federal dollars annually – money that would be jeopardized if the university was found to tolerate an unequal learning environment.
In 2004, I wrote an article for New York magazine about my own experience of having been sexually encroached upon as a third-year undergraduate at Yale by an esteemed professor (the crime of “sexual harassment” had not yet been codified).
I wrote, too, about Yale’s cover-up of many situations like mine.
So the students’ lawsuit was not surprising to me.
Indeed, in the course of trying to report to the university in 2004 what had happened to me in 1983, I found the same pattern of stonewalling victims and defending perpetrators.
Worse still, I discovered that the university and its lawyers used the sexual harassment “grievance procedure” as a screen to protect the institution, its harassers, and even its rapists, rather than as a means to investigate incidents of abuse.
This situation had persisted for two decades.
As I conducted my reporting, I heard woman after woman allege that the same professor or the same fraternity had engaged in multiple instances of assault or harassment.
Victim after victim would plead, heartbreakingly, “Help me.” But I could do nothing, because the women chose to remain anonymous, and because the university treated each case as top secret.
Alleged perpetrators were free to teach in a new university – where more young women (and in some cases, young men) would become their prey.
Compounding the lack of transparency, Yale maintains its own campus police force, to which sex-crime victims are encouraged to report their complaints if they insist upon formal documentation. But victims often do not understand that this actually tends to contain potentially embarrassing scandals, by preventing real – that is, accountable – law enforcement from getting involved.
Indeed, there have been disclosed to me reports of at least three alleged sex assaults by faculty or academic staff in the past decade – two alleged incidents reported by two different women involving the same man.
I know that one undergraduate has more recently pursued legal action against a staff member, who, she said, drugged her with Rohypnol, the “date rape” drug, and assaulted her.
I know these accounts, but I can’t report them, even at this critical moment in the long-overdue formal investigation, because of confidentiality protocols.
Each of these women feels alone.
Like virtually every private university in the United States, Yale has relied on “privacy” to keep these incidents under wraps, so that incoming women (and men) have no idea who among the faculty or students is dangerous; which fraternity is a site of repeated harassment or worse; and when to keep the door open on a student-teacher meeting.
Like the Catholic Church, private universities like Yale can use victims’ shame and isolation to disenfranchise them and to protect the perpetrators.
But I believe that the victims themselves have a responsibility.
The convention of taking sex-crime testimony from alleged victims behind closed doors, under conditions of anonymity or confidentiality, only serves institutions like universities or the military that are intent on covering up criminal behavior.
Some feminists have attacked me for this position, but the numbers bear me out: thirty years ago, 30% of reported rapes in the US and the United Kingdom resulted in prosecutions; today, after three decades of confidential sex-crime reporting, the number is 12% in the US and 6% in the UK.
This is largely because confidentiality in sex-crime reporting prevents the media from shining a light on the crime, inhibits institutional memory of repeated assailants, and prevents scrutiny of whether a court, college, or police precinct is doing better or worse at handling such cases.
As a result, serious crimes can be swept under the rug – at Yale and at every other private US university I have ever visited (public universities are less free to conceal crime data) – in the guise of “protecting the victims.”
Yale alumnae are reportedly now contacting these 16 students with their own stories of sexual assault and harassment, spanning two decades. But if they had come forward publicly years ago, it is likely that Yale could not have continued for so long to protect the sex criminals in its midst.
The students are right: a sexually abusive environment does make it harder for students to study and learn. But victims – whether current students or alumnae – would be well advised to take a deep breath, come forward, and tell their stories out loud.
Only then would Yale and other institutions be forced to reckon publicly with a problem that has persisted for generations.

Yankee Bases Go Home
RIO DE JANEIRO – Last month, the leaders of all 12 countries of South America (except one) gathered in Quito, Ecuador’s capital, for the summit of the Union of South American Nations.
UNASUR or UNASUL (depending on whether one speaks Spanish or Portuguese) was established by the twelve presidents in Brasília in May 2008 with the aim of furthering economic and political integration.
Instead, Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez hijacked the Quito meeting to propagate his Bolivarian Revolution and expound his own ideas for the continent’s future as independent of the United States.
Thanks to America’s recently announced military agreement with Colombia, Chávez’s ideas got more of a hearing than might have been expected.
For, instead of infrastructure plans, commercial or environmental treaties, or even multilateral action against such common problems as violence and poverty, the issue that dominated both press accounts and the speeches at the gathering was the new US-Colombian military agreement, announced less than a month before the summit.
To no one’s surprise, Chávez dominated the criticism of the pact.
He claimed that the “Winds of war are blowing,” and that the announcement of the military agreement “can transform itself into a tragedy.”
Unfortunately, Colombian President Álvaro Uribe was absent from the meeting.
Colombia and Ecuador broke diplomatic relations in March 2008, after Colombia’s army pursued FARC guerillas, who have been fighting Colombia’s government for decades, into Ecuadorean territory.
So Uribe could not defend the new military agreement.
This left the floor open to Chávez to isolate Colombia and preach against the US.
In a continent where anti-Americanism remains both very popular and an effective way to consolidate national cohesion and political power, Chávez’s attacks found a ready audience.
In addition, Uribe’s absence allowed Chávez to avoid responding to Colombia’s accusations that Venezuela and its ally Ecuador support the narco-Marxist FARC.
One week after the summit, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tried to calm the continent’s fears about the US-Colombia agreement, explaining that it is merely a minor revision of the Bill Clinton-era Plan Colombia, an American program to support the government against the drug cartels.
But her words did little soothing.
Nor did it seem to help that even most local military analysts say that the agreement does not represent any major change in the US military position on the continent.
The simple fact is that the timing of the announcement of the pact was terrible, and gave a platform for Bolivarian rants that will not be without consequences.
Indeed, the ongoing fallout is likely to remain very negative.
By raising anti-American suspicions and strengthening Chávez’s position across the continent, the agreement weakens the influence of Brazil.
Recently, Brazil had been differentiating itself from the rest of the continent through its stable economy and vibrant democratic political system, both of which were helping the country’s poor.
So the spread and strengthening of Chávez’s so-called Bolivarian Revolution was not in Brazil’s interests, even though some of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s officials appear to be fans of Chávez and his administration.
The terrible timing of the US-Colombia military agreement also gave Chávez and his allies a reason to build up their armies against the “evil imperialist ianque .”
After all, one must remember, the Bolivarian Revolution’s supposed “enemy�� is the US, and no one else.
So the agreement may legitimize and produce an arms race in South America, which is in no one’s interest.
Another unexpected consequence of the US-Colombia military agreement may be a further heightening of tensions between Venezuela and Colombia.
The radical polarization of the Andean region between those two countries will create difficulties in building regional consensus and security problems in the Amazon, as well as weakening the Brazilian project for South American political and economic integration.
Finally, another major consequence of the US-Colombia deal are the doubts that it has created in Latin America about President Barack Obama’s administration, and about the future of relations between the US and South America, especially Brazil, the main regional power.
The agreement revived the perception that US diplomacy lacks sensitivity where the region is concerned.
If Obama wants to encourage moderate and democratic politics in South America, and to bolster Brazil’s efforts to foster stability and economic progress against the region’s radical and undemocratic forces, it must take greater care in not appearing to undermine those the US claims to support.
For Chávez is showing that the old cry of “Yankee go home” still resonates.

The Periphery’s Purgatory
ATHENS – German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s upcoming visit to Athens will be a far less tense affair than her earlier journeys here during Europe’s long financial crisis.
Of course, Greeks have little love for Merkel; but, thanks to Europe’s modest economic recovery, some of the poison has been drawn from Germany’s relations with Europe’s most damaged and distressed economies.
Indeed, Europe is no longer considered a risk to global financial stability.
The eurozone’s core economies are showing signs of revival, and financial conditions in the over-indebted periphery are improving as well.
But, given capital shortages, depressed demand, and the slow pace of reform in the eurozone periphery, continued progress is far from certain.
In the eurozone economies that were hit hardest by the global economic crisis, the output and employment losses have been huge and persistent.
Real (inflation-adjusted) per capita income in the eurozone as a whole hovers around its 2007 level; in Greece and Italy, however, it has sunk to the levels recorded in 2000 and 1997, respectively.
Meanwhile, the eurozone’s overall unemployment rate is 12%, and it is much higher in the periphery.
In Spain, more than 25% of the labor force is jobless, while Italy’s youth unemployment rate stands at 42%.
In Greece, where the overall unemployment rate has climbed to 28%, some 60% of the country’s young people are unemployed.
Recovering from such crippling employment losses will not be easy, and will require a speedy return to high and sustainable growth rates.
Consider Greece, where the government is planning a return to the capital markets in the coming months to finance the country’s long-term borrowing needs, even though securing such financing would require paying unsustainably high interest rates.
The fact that the government seems willing to do so translates clearly its desire to move beyond the influence of the “troika” (the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission, and the European Central Bank).
Indeed, since 2008, Greece’s GDP has shrunk by almost 25%.
Recovering lost capacity will require large amounts of capital, but there are five reasons why such financing is unlikely, under present conditions, to be forthcoming:
· As a result of austerity, public investment as a share of GDP continues to fall and has now reached a record low.
Having already committed substantial rescue funds, eurozone authorities do not seem inclined to inject fresh capital.
· Sources of domestic private capital are limited, because the recession and the related near-collapse of asset prices, along with a sharp increase in taxation – particularly on high incomes and on capital – significantly weakened balance sheets.
· Bank lending has slowed drastically, as a result of Greek banks effectively defaulting in the wake of the troika-imposed losses on sovereign creditors and the nationalization of the country’s banks.
A record-low level of deposits and the recession-related rise of non-performing loans have weakened Greek banks’ capital position further.
(Today, companies in the eurozone periphery borrow at substantially higher rates than their counterparts in the core. For bank loans, the ratio is almost two to one; for long-term financing, it may reach as high as ten to one.)
· Greece’s unsustainable debt position is discouraging foreign private investment.
The assumptions about primary surpluses, private-sector involvement, and GDP growth underlying the government’s commitment to reduce its debt level, which currently exceeds 170% of GDP, to 124% of GDP by 2020 cannot be realized, given Germany’s opposition to restructuring the official financing that replaced the defaulted private loans.
Some easing of loan conditionality – via extended maturities and reduced interest rates ‒ will be agreed later this year, but it will not be enough to calm fears of a new default.
· Trust between foreign and Greek investors is lacking, and it will not be restored until debt sustainability is achieved.
But Germany and the other core eurozone countries consistently block any proposal that contemplates debt mutualization or fiscal union.
Ideas such as Eurobonds, a single European finance ministry, and increased capitalization of Europe’s common rescue funds (the European Stability Mechanism and the Single Resolution Mechanism) are not even being contemplated.
Along with inadequate capital supply, Greece is suffering from a demand shortfall, as the troika continues to squeeze the country with harsh austerity.
If these policies are not relaxed or offset by more expansionary policies in the eurozone core, demand will remain depressed, discouraging further investment.
Finally, on the reform front, time is running out.
For the last few years, rather than confronting the special interests – state-protected businesses, public-sector trade unions, and lobbies – that inhibit reform, Greece has spread its economic misery horizontally through blanket spending cuts.
Reforms such as privatizing state-owned enterprises, opening up closed professions, abolishing restrictive business practices, and reducing the size of the public sector have been undertaken very slowly and inefficiently, and they will not significantly alter growth prospects.
As it stands, Greece is unlikely to meet the recovery challenge – and other peripheral economies will probably falter, too.
Sufficient reforms and capital are lacking, while the social rifts resulting from austerity increase the risk of potentially devastating political instability. With the European Parliament election approaching, the prospect of populist anti-austerity parties prevailing in the periphery – and of anti-euro, anti-bailout parties gaining power in the core – heightens the risk of instability even more.
Should financial turbulence return and herald a new eurozone crisis, the monetary union’s sustainability will again be called into question.
To prevent this outcome, Greece and the eurozone’s other peripheral economies must limit austerity, buttress demand, undertake reform, increase investment support, and pursue fiscal union.
Unfortunately, these keys to ensuring a cohesive and prosperous eurozone are likely to be left unturned – until, perhaps, the next crisis occurs.

The Re-Division of Europe
ATHENS – As the eurozone debt crisis has steadily widened the divide between Europe’s stronger northern economies and the weaker, more debt-laden economies in the south (with France a kind of no man’s land economy in between), one question is on everyone’s mind: Can Europe’s monetary union – indeed, the European Union itself – survive?
While the eurozone’s northern members enjoy low borrowing costs and stable growth, its southern members face high borrowing costs, recession, and deep cuts in incomes and social spending.
They have also suffered substantial output losses, and have far higher unemployment rates than their northern counterparts.
Unemployment in the eurozone as a whole averages about 12%, compared to more than 25% in Spain and Greece (where youth unemployment now stands at 60%).
Indeed, while aggregate per capita income in the eurozone remains at 2007 levels, Greece has been pushed back to 2000 levels, and Italy today finds itself somewhere in 1997.
Europe’s southern economies owe their deteriorating circumstances largely to excessive austerity and the absence of measures to compensate for demand losses.
Currency devaluation – which would boost the competitiveness of domestic industry by lowering export prices – obviously is not an option in a monetary union.
But Europe’s stronger economies have resisted pressure to undertake more expansionary fiscal policies, which would lift demand for its weaker economies’ exports.
The European Central Bank did not follow the lead of other advanced-country central banks, such as the US Federal Reserve, in pursuing a more aggressive monetary policy to cut borrowing costs.
And no financing has been offered for public-investment projects in the southern countries.
Moreover, fiscal and financial measures aimed at strengthening eurozone governance have been inadequate to restore confidence in the euro.
And Europe’s troubled economies have been slow to undertake structural reforms; improvements in competitiveness reflect wage and salary cuts, rather than productivity gains.
While these policies – or lack thereof – have impeded recovery in the southern countries, they have yielded reasonable growth and very low unemployment rates for the northern economies.
In fact, by maintaining large trade surpluses, Germany is exporting unemployment and recession to its weaker neighbors.
As Europe’s north-south divide widens, so will interest-rate differentials; as a result, conducting a single monetary policy will become increasingly difficult.
In the recession-afflicted south, continued fiscal consolidation will demand new austerity measures – a prospect that citizens will reject.
Such impasses will lead to social tension and political crisis, or to new requests for financial assistance, which the northern countries are certain to resist.
Either way, financial and political instability could lead to the common currency’s collapse.
As long as the eurozone establishes a kind of wary equilibrium, with the weaker economies stabilizing at low growth rates, current policies are unlikely to change.
Incremental intergovernmental solutions will continue to prevail, and Europe’s economy will soldier on, steadily losing ground to the US and emerging economies like China and India.
For now, Germany is satisfied with the status quo, enjoying stable growth and retaining control over domestic economic policy, while the ECB’s limited powers and strict mandate to maintain price stability ease fears of inflation.
But how will Germany react when the north-south divide becomes large enough to threaten the euro’s survival?
The answer depends on how Germans perceive their long-term interests, and on the choices of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Her recent election to a third term offers room for bolder policy choices, while forcing her to focus more on her legacy – specifically, whether she wishes to be associated with the euro’s collapse or with its revival.
Two outcomes now seem possible.
One scenario is that the economic and political crisis in the southern countries spreads, inciting fears in Germany that the country faces a long-term threat.
This could drive Germany to withdraw from the eurozone and form a smaller currency union with other northern countries.
The second possibility is that the crisis remains relatively contained, leading Germany to pursue closer economic and fiscal union.
This would entail the mutualization of some national debt and the transfer of economic-policy sovereignty to supranational European institutions.
Of course, such a move would carry considerable political costs in Germany, where many taxpayers recoil at the notion of assuming the debts of the fiscally profligate southern countries, without considering how much Germany would benefit from a stable and dynamic monetary union.
But a new grand coalition between Merkel and the Social Democrats could be sufficient to make this shift possible.
Even so, there could be victims.
Indeed, the continued failure of smaller countries like Greece and Cyprus to fulfill their commitments reinforces the impression that they will forever be dependent on financial assistance.
The exit of one or two of these “undisciplined” countries could be a requirement for the German public to agree to such a policy shift.
Europe’s north-south divide has become a time bomb lying at the foundations of the currency union.
Defusing it will require less austerity, more demand stimulus, greater investment support, deeper reforms, and meaningful progress toward economic and political union.
One hopes that modest recovery in the south, aided by strong German leadership in the north, will steer Europe in the right direction.

China’s Singapore Swing
BEIJING – The Chinese Communist Party has released the final document of the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee.
In the CCP’s history, the third plenum has traditionally been the occasion for the party to announce its major policies for the next 5-10 years.
This year happened to be one of leadership transition, so the third plenum became more important.
As expected, its final document unveils a plan for comprehensive reforms that will reshape China’s economy and society in the next decade.
For starters, the household registration (hukou) system will be reformed.
Small cities and towns will allow migrants to apply for the local hukou with no strings attached, and medium-size cities will do the same, with some restrictions.
Although large cities will remain as closed as ever, the new policy will dramatically weaken the institutional foundation of China’s long history of urban-rural and regional divides.
Similarly, the one-child policy that has been enforced for the last 34 years will be modified.
In most provinces, parents who are both single children themselves already can have two children.
The new policy recommends that provinces allow couples to have two children if either parent is a single child.
While this will affect only around 10 million couples – a small number in a country of more than 1.3 billion people – the reform represents a gigantic step toward ending the one-child rule.
Farmers, moreover, will be granted the right to sell their residential land on the open market and will be much more likely to be compensated at market rates when their land is taken by the government.
State-owned enterprises (SOEs), meanwhile, are expected to surrender more of their profits to the government – up to 30% by 2020.
This extra revenue will be used to finance China’s social-security system.
Indeed, from now on, the central government will take over social-security expenditure, establishing nationally unified pension and health-insurance systems, while the retirement age will be raised gradually.
Currently, women can retire at the age of 50, and men at 55 – ridiculously low by global standards and clearly unsustainable, given China’s rapidly aging population.
SOEs’ power will be curtailed in other ways.
Their ability to stifle innovation will be weakened by a drastic reduction in the government’s power to restrict the entry of new competitors into all areas of the economy, as well as a major effort to reduce bureaucratic red tape.
Financial liberalization, too, will be deepened, which will help startups and private firms most of all.
In addition to pledging to liberalize exchange and interest rates, the final document also calls for allowing domestic private capital to form small and medium-size banks.
And, in an effort to bring coherence to commercial courts’ rulings, the court system will be directly financed by the central government, rather than by the corresponding local government.
This promises to strengthen the independence of the court system at the local level.
All of these reforms have long been expected.
But the third plenum also provided surprises, including the creation of a leading group within the CCP to steer reform.
China used to have a reform commission within the executive branch; the establishment of the leading group indicates the CCP’s commitment, and that of President Xi Jinping, to comprehensive reform.
A second surprise is the document’s emphasis on the market.
In the past, government direction was emphasized, despite an acknowledgement of the market’s positive role.
Now, for the first time, the CCP is officially calling for “allowing the market to take a central role in resource allocation.”
A final surprise is that the document sets a timeframe to complete all of the reforms; by 2020, China is supposed to become a full-fledged market economy.
This is the first time in recent history that the CCP has set a specific deadline for policymaking.
And yet, while all of these measures are encouraging signs, some key items are missing.
For example, there was no clear mention of further SOE reform.
Likewise, though the document calls for strengthening local legislatures, it proposes no concrete plan to curb local governments’ role in economic activities, which is one of the sources of distortions in the Chinese economy.
This is related to the final document’s most significant lacuna: political reform.
In fact, a Singapore-style approach – combining a freewheeling market economy and an authoritarian regime – has clearly emerged from the plenum.
It is an approach that awaits the test of time.
Singapore is a city-state of five million people – roughly the population of the Haidian district of Beijing.
Given China’s much greater size and complexity, the Chinese government’s pursuit of the Singaporean model, with its suppression of any and all social disorder, would ultimately undermine economic dynamism.
To build the innovative economy envisioned by the third plenum, the CCP’s leadership needs to find a new governance model that fosters a vibrant society.
Sooner rather than later, the crucially important economic reforms that have just been unveiled will not be enough.

China’s Real-Estate Wrongs
BEIJING – China’s real-estate sector has been a source of serious concern for several years, with soaring property prices raising fears of overheating in the housing market.
But, with price growth easing, it seems that the government’s campaign to rein in property risk is finally taking hold.
The danger now is that the housing market will collapse – bringing China’s economic prospects down with it.
In its effort to control rising housing prices, China’s government has pursued nine distinct policies, not all of which have served their purpose.
Though policies like limits on mortgages for first-time buyers and minimum residency requirements for purchasing property in a first-tier city like Beijing or Shanghai helped to ease demand, supply-side tactics, such as limiting credit to real-estate developers and imposing new taxes on property sales, have proved to be counter-productive.
This flawed approach allowed China’s housing prices to continue to rise steadily, fueling major housing bubbles, especially in first-tier cities.
The average Beijing resident would have to save all of his or her income for 34 years before to be able to purchase an apartment outright. In Shanghai and Guangzhou, the equivalent is 29 and 27 years, respectively – much higher than in other major international cities.
The expectation that this trend will continue has driven homeowners to retain possession of their properties, even though rental rates amount to less than 2% of a property’s market value.
But, with the real-estate sector finally facing a downturn, the time to rethink this investment strategy has arrived.
In the first four months of 2014, housing sales dropped by nearly 7% year on year, with construction of new floor area falling by more than 22%.
As a result, downward pressure on property prices is mounting.
In normal times, citizens and officials alike would welcome this trend.
But, at a time of weakening economic performance, China cannot afford an implosion of the real-estate sector, which accounts for at least 30% of overall growth.
Indeed, though China’s government has expressed its willingness to sacrifice some growth in its pursuit of structural reform and rebalancing, the impact of a housing-market collapse on the financial sector would cause growth to slow beyond the acceptable limit.
That impact partly reflects the highly problematic nature of the Chinese government’s long-awaited move to liberalize interest rates.
Instead of taking a direct approach – lifting the interest-rate cap imposed on banks – liberalization has been achieved by allowing shadow banking to flourish.
As a result, a large number of nonbank financial institutions – such as wealth-management companies and online financial-services providers – are now using promises of high returns to attract small investors.
Making matters worse, the monetary authorities have tightened the credit supply, in an effort to deleverage the Chinese economy.
While both interest-rate liberalization and deleveraging are critical to the long-term health of China’s economy, the skyrocketing cost of borrowing is forcing many low-risk companies, which are unable to offer sufficiently high rates of return, out of the market.
At the same time, real-estate developers who have borrowed heavily from shadow-banking institutions, based on the assumption that property prices would continue to rise steadily, may struggle to repay their debts, with a sharp decline in prices inevitably leading to defaults.
Given that the formal banking sector provides a large share of shadow-banking finance, this could initiate a chain reaction affecting the entire financial sector.
Many remain convinced that China’s government – which wields with the world’s largest foreign-exchange reserves and virtually unchecked authority – would be able to prevent a major financial crisis.
But the financial crisis in the fast-growing city of Wenzhou, triggered by bad loans, suggests otherwise – not least because the economy has yet to recover fully.
There is no reason to believe that a similar crisis could not occur on a national scale.
To avoid such an outcome, China’s leaders must urgently adopt counter-cyclical measures.
They should begin by eliminating non-market-based restrictions on the real-estate sector, which have generated serious distortions not only to the economy, but also to people’s lives, with couples divorcing temporarily to gain the right to purchase an additional apartment.
When it comes to the real-estate sector, China’s government has consistently had the right objective and the wrong strategy.
It is time to align intention with action.
Otherwise, China’s financial sector – indeed, its entire economy – will suffer.

In Praise of China’s New Normal
BEIJING – China’s economy is, at long last, undergoing a rebalancing, with growth rates having declined from more than 10% before 2008 to roughly 7.5% today.
Is this China’s “new normal,” or should the country anticipate even slower growth in the coming decade?
China’s rebalancing is apparent, first and foremost, in the export sector.
Export growth has slowed from its 2001-2008 average of 29% annually to below 10%, making foreign demand a far less critical engine of growth.
Moreover, manufacturing employment and output, as a share of the total, began to decline last year.
In fact, in the first half of this year, services accounted for more than half of total economic growth.
It is no surprise, then, that China’s current-account surplus has shrunk rapidly, from its 2007 peak of more than 10% of GDP to about 2% of GDP today.
This rebalancing has helped to improve China’s income distribution.
Indeed, in recent years, labor’s share of national income has been on the rise – a direct reflection of the decline in manufacturing and expansion in services.
That has meant greater regional balance as well: The coastal provinces, which produce more than 85% of the country’s exports, are experiencing the most pronounced slowdown, while inland provinces have maintained relatively high growth rates.
As a result, China’s Gini coefficient (a 100-point index of inequality, in which zero signifies absolute equality and one absolute inequality) fell to 0.50 in 2012, from 0.52 in 2010.
Two principal factors are driving this shift.
The first is the decline in global demand in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, which has forced China to adjust its growth model sooner than anticipated.
The second is China’s ongoing demographic transformation.
The share of working-age people (16-65 years old) in the total population has been declining since its 2010 peak of 72%.
And the absolute number of working-age people has been falling since 2012.
At the same time, China is undergoing rapid urbanization, with some 200 million people having left the agricultural sector in 2001-2008 to seek urban manufacturing jobs.
More recently, however, the pace of migration has slowed substantially, with rural areas retaining 35% of China’s total labor force.
All of this implies lower growth rates for China – though perhaps not as low as the 6-7% rates that economists like Liu Shijing and Cai Fang are predicting for the next decade.
In fact, relying on China’s past growth record to predict future performance is inherently problematic, owing not only to important shifts in the labor force, but also to the fact that the speed and scale of China’s pre-2008 growth was unprecedented.
For starters, it is likely that the contribution to output growth of the rising ratio of working-age people prior to 2010 was overestimated.
That makes the subsequent decline in the ratio an inaccurate measure with which to determine the negative impact on economic performance.
Moreover, this approach neglects the educational dividends that China will enjoy over the next 20 years, as the younger generation replaces older workers.
As it stands, the rate of return-adjusted educational attainment for Chinese aged 50-60 is half that of those aged 20-25.
In other words, young workers will be twice as productive as those entering retirement.
Indeed, the level of educational attainment in China continues to improve.
By 2020, the share of those aged 18-22 who are pursuing a college education will reach 40%, compared to 32% today.
This improvement in human capital is bound to offset, to some extent, the net loss of labor.
Furthermore, China’s low retirement age – 50 for women and 60 for men – provides policymakers with considerable room to maneuver.
Increasing the retirement age by just a half-year for each of the next ten years would more than compensate for the annual decline in the labor force, which is projected to be 2.5 million workers during this period.
Other trends are boosting China’s prospects further.
Though investment is likely to decline as a share of GDP, it will probably take a decade for it to dip below 40% – still robust by international standards.
Meanwhile, the capital stock can maintain a reasonable growth rate.
Finally, China’s capacity for innovation is improving steadily, owing to rapidly increasing human capital and rising investment in research and development.
By next year, Chinese R&D expenditure, at 2.2% of GDP, will be closing in on advanced-country levels.
Based on these trends – and assuming a constant labor-participation rate – China’s potential growth rate over the next decade is likely to hover around 6.9-7.6%, averaging 7.27%.
This may be much lower than the 9.4% average growth rate in 1988-2013, but it is more than adequate by global standards.
If this is China’s “new normal,” it would still be the envy of the rest of the world.

China’s Shadow Menace
BEIJING – The US Federal Reserve’s decision to exit from so-called “quantitative easing” – its massive monthly purchases of long-term assets – is stoking fears of a hard economic landing in China.
But China’s strong economic fundamentals mean that policymakers have the space to avoid such an outcome – as long as they bring the country’s shadow banking system under control.
As it stands, Chinese consumption and investment growth is expected to remain at roughly last year’s levels.
Meanwhile, economic recovery in the advanced economies, especially the United States and Europe, is reinvigorating external demand, leading analysts to project annual Chinese export growth of more than 10% this year – 3-4 percentage points higher than in 2013.
This would bring annual GDP growth in 2014 to a very healthy 7.5-8%.
The problem is that China’s financial sector has accumulated considerable risk in recent years, with broad money (M2) having ballooned to ¥110.7 trillion ($18 trillion) – almost twice the country’s GDP – at the end of last year.
In an attempt to rein in M2, which could indicate that the economy is overleveraged, the central bank tightened conditions for commercial bank lending, so that, for any given increase in M2, less credit is extended.
But the move failed to contain M2 growth; on the contrary, M2 grew faster last year than in 2012.
Worse, restricting commercial banks’ role as financial intermediaries and encouraging the growth of unregulated shadow banking has generated even more risks for China’s economy.
Clearly, a new approach is needed – one that is based on a deeper understanding of the dangers inherent in China’s banking system.
While it is true that surging M2 can reflect excessive leverage, it is not a particularly accurate gauge in China, where commercial banks can easily circumvent high reserve requirements and quantitative controls by moving loans off their balance sheets to wealth-management products – practices that fuel artificial credit expansion that looks like M2 growth.
In this sense, it is the Chinese monetary authorities’ reluctance to open up the formal financial sector to domestic private capital, or to liberalize the deposit rate, that is fueling the expansion of shadow banking.
With small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) – by far the economy’s most important growth engine – unable to acquire sufficient funding from the formal financial sector, they have been forced to turn to informal channels.
As shadow banking has become the primary source of finance for SMEs – which tend to be higher-risk borrowers – the financial risks in China’s economy have grown exponentially.
Exacerbating matters, the central bank’s repeated efforts to tighten the money supply raises the cost of capital.
Last June, the annualized interbank lending rate surged to more than 10% – a level that it almost matched in December.
SMEs ultimately shoulder these costs, diminishing their ability to contribute to overall economic growth.
Consider the Internet giant Alibaba, which began using Zhi-fu-bao, the Chinese equivalent of PayPal, to raise money last year.
In just a few months, it received ¥400 billion from 85 million small investors.
Tencent, China’s largest Internet company, is now using the same strategy to compete with Alibaba, with both companies offering high rates of return – often 6-7% annually – to attract as many investors as possible.
The problem is that most of this investment is in the interbank market, meaning that SMEs ultimately face interest rates of more than 10% – and that does not include the added 3% for SMEs’ loan guarantees.
These unsustainable high rates are transmitting major risks to the real economy.
Nowhere is this more apparent than in the real-estate sector.
Liquidity-thirsty developers, unable to acquire financing through the formal banking sector, have been taking out massive loans at extremely high interest rates.
But, in many cases, housing demand has not grown as expected, raising the risk of default – the effects of which would be transmitted to the entire financial sector.
The fact is that China has never been closer to a major financial crisis than it is today.
Yet China’s monetary authorities do not seem to understand the scale of the risk – or its root causes.
The Chinese economy may well need to be deleveraged. But, instead of blindly tightening the credit supply, policymakers must pursue deep financial-sector reform to liberalize the deposit rate, eliminate quantitative controls, and, most important, allow for the establishment of domestic private financial institutions.
Pursuing this agenda is essential to China’s long-term financial and economic health.
But doing so presupposes a major shift in Chinese monetary authorities’ mindset.
Therein lies the real challenge facing China today.

Blue is the New Green
ABU DHABI – In recent years, an increasingly loud chorus of environmentalists, civil-society actors, and international institutions have been demanding that conventional “brown” economic development, which depends on fossil fuels, be replaced by a lower-carbon “green” growth model. But there is a third, more competitive option: a “blue” economy driven by business-level innovation, rather than top-down policies.
The fact is that most environmentally friendly technologies demand significant upfront investment, meaning that “going green” remains a privilege reserved for the few countries that can afford it.
After all, governments’ capacity to provide subsidies is limited, and wealthy countries cannot be expected to bear the costs of the uptake of sustainable technologies worldwide.
Thus, as the United Nations recently confirmed, more than a billion people worldwide still lack access to reliable, clean, and affordable energy.
The blue economy – a concept developed by the Belgian economist Gunter Pauli – is powered less by investment and more by innovation, with a focus on creating jobs, building social capital, and generating multiple cash flows by stimulating entrepreneurship and the development of new business models.
The blue economy is centered on the idea that companies should use all available resources and increase efficiency to develop a portfolio of related businesses that benefit both them and society.
Consider the Swedish company Solarus AB, whose innovative business model – manufacturing solar panels out of carbon fibers discarded by the aerospace industry – has enabled it to offer competitively priced solar technologies, without support from government subsidies.
The fact that solar technologies can be produced locally from recycled materials, Pauli argues, means that governments should not provide solar-related subsidies and bailouts – the costs of which eventually land on taxpayers.
The blue economy would also help to resolve the intermittency problem inherent in solar- or wind-power systems.
Even after the needed technologies are deployed widely, additional investment in power storage or a back-up energy would be needed.
Given that an abundant hydropower backup supply would not be an option everywhere, businesses would have to find ways to employ the energy and resources available locally.
It is not difficult to discern the potential benefits – for businesses and communities alike – of matching a set of seemingly disparate problems with the efficient use of locally available resources.
Companies simply must be willing to develop bold and creative new business models that change the rules of the game.
For example, the production of coffee – a coffee company’s only revenue stream – typically requires only 0.2% of the coffee plant.
Instead of discarding the remaining 99.8%, the company could, say, grow mushrooms and, with the waste from that process, create a protein-rich livestock feed, which could also be converted into a natural source of energy.
Nuru Energy put this kind of innovation into practice, developing a human-powered cycle that provides clean power across Africa using recyclable plastic parts and locally available materials.
Likewise, in the United Kingdom, Cyndi Rhoades launched “Worn Again,” which produces fashionable products from unusual recycled materials like scrap leather from car seats, parachutes, and prison blankets.
Of course, the idea of reusing materials within continuous closed loops to extract their maximum value is not a new one. But it has recently been revived, with the emergence of the “circular economy” concept, which calls for the continual re-exploitation of resources through the reuse and refurbishment of products, components, and materials.
A report in 2012 by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation estimated that the circular economy concept could save the European Union alone $380 billion annually in materials for medium-lifespan consumer durables such as cars, furniture, and household electric appliances.
The second and third volumes of the report estimated that the world could save as much as $700 billion each year on single-use consumer goods like packaged food and beverages.
Incorporating such loops into the broader framework of the blue economy would bring even greater benefits.
As the world heads toward catastrophic levels of resource depletion and environmental degradation, calls for a new economic model – whether green, blue, circular, or something else –will only grow louder. And many people are willing to put their money where their mouth is.
The proliferation of information technology and social media means that it is easier than ever for entrepreneurs to tap into a large pool of finance – not to mention contacts and expertise – from small investors.
Of the roughly 500 crowdfunding platforms that now exist, several specifically target clean technologies.
Last May, Eureeca.com took the crowdfunding concept further than ever, creating the first truly global crowd-investing marketplace that offers equity in funded companies.
If used wisely, such platforms could take up the slack created by governments’ fiscal constraints to facilitate the entrepreneurial innovations needed to build the blue economy.
Other increasingly prominent trends – such as collaborative consumption, pay per use, and sharing and leasing models – could offer similarly powerful impetus to these efforts.
Given the impracticality – financial and otherwise – of relying on top-down solutions, the creation of a cleaner economy should rely on visionary entrepreneurs who can transform challenges into opportunities.
Sustainability begins at the grass roots.

Will the Yellow Vests Reject the Brown Shirts?
PARIS – From the moment the French government canceled its planned fuel tax hike in the face of massive protests, it was obvious that the move would be perceived as inadequate, insignificant, and above all incapable of having any calming effect.
Honor to whom honor is due: the Yellow Vests claim to be an expression of the sovereign people.
But they now bear a heavy responsibility.
For starters, they must announce a moratorium on demonstrations and blockades for a period long enough to accommodate the dialogue proposed by Prime Minister Édouard Philippe, if not longer.
In particular, they should renounce the much-touted December 8 “Act IV” of the movement, brewing on Facebook since Saturday evening, which everyone expects to be more violent, destructive, and tragic than the preceding installments.
There have been enough deaths, injuries, and damage (including to some of the most famous monuments in Paris).
If the Yellow Vests decide the machine they have unleashed has overtaken them, and they can no longer stop Act IV, they must be prepared during the protests to help the police flush out the violent “brown vests” who will be circulating among them.
Because the wreckers of the far right and far left will surely reappear to vandalize, terrorize, and desecrate; it is up to the Yellow Vests to say once again, this time as if they really mean it: Not in our name.
Whether the Yellow Vests declare a moratorium or continue to protest, nothing would serve their cause better than to dissociate themselves – decisively and unambiguously – from all the political profiteers who would capitalize on their misery.
The cast of opportunists is well known.
Here is Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who, having finished fourth in the 2017 presidential election won by Emmanuel Macron, is desperately seeking a new following.
There is François Ruffin, the leader of the anti-austerity movement Nuit debout, with his irresponsible anti-republican calls of “Resign, Macron!”
And over there is Marine Le Pen, oscillating comically between taking pride in and repenting her call to occupy the Champs Élysées last Saturday, thereby becoming accountable for the worst of what was said and done there.
And there the intellectuals who, in the manner of Luc Ferry and Emmanuel Todd, suggest that it was perhaps not “by chance” that the wreckers had such an easy time approaching, storming, and sacking the Arc de Triomphe.
Such rhetoric lays the worst of all traps for a popular movement: the trap of conspiratorial thinking.
In other words, the Yellow Vests are at a crossroads.
Either they will be bold enough to stop and take the time they need to get organized, following a path not unlike that of Macron’s own La République en Marche !, which, in hindsight, might appear to be the Yellow Vests’ first-to-arrive twin.
Macron’s movement, too, had right and left wings.
And it knew that it was a new political body, engaging in a dialogue or even a showdown that would lead to an honest reckoning with poverty and the high cost of living.
If the Yellow Vests build a movement that rises to the height of Macron’s, it may end up writing a page in the history of France.
Or the Yellow Vests may turn out to lack that boldness and settle for the paltry pleasure of being seen on television.
They will allow themselves to become intoxicated by the sight of luminaries and experts of la France d’en haut (elite France) seeming to eat from their hands and hanging on their every word.
But if the Yellow Vests allow passionate hate to win out over genuine fraternity and choose wrecking over reforming, they will bring only chaos, not improvement, to the lives of humble and vulnerable people.
They will careen off into the darkest side of the political night, and end up in the dustbin of history, where they can rub elbows with those other yellows, the early-twentieth-century “Yellow Socialists” of the proto-fascist syndicalist Pierre Biétry.
The Yellow Vests must choose: democratic re-invention, or an updated version of the national socialist leagues; a will to repair, or the urge to destroy.
The decision will hinge on the historic essence of the movement – whether its reflexes are good or bad, and whether, in the final analysis, it possesses political and moral courage.
So the ball is in the Yellow Vests’ court.
They have the initiative as much as Macron does.
Will they say, “Yes, we believe in republican democracy?”
And will they say it loud and clear, without equivocation?
Or will they place themselves in the tradition of paranoid nihilism and pollute their ranks with the political vandals that France still produces in abundance?

Macron’s Misstep Is Europe’s Loss
PARIS – Are the Yellow Vest protests across France as consequential as the mass rallies of May 1968?
It is too soon to say.
The revolt has forced French President Emmanuel Macron to make significant and costly concessions, but it is hardly a new French Revolution.
Though some demonstrators clearly want to reenact the “feats” of their ancestors against their (elected) monarch, we are not in July 1789.
The uprising of May 1968, it is worth recalling, was driven largely by a bored generation of students living at the peak of France’s post-war prosperity.
Though the economy was at full employment, they rebelled against the status quo in the name of dubious utopias inspired by Fidel Castro’s Cuba and Mao’s China.
They were joined by well-organized trade unions that helped the movement reach a critical mass, at least temporarily.
The difference between then and now is that those taking to the streets to protest against Macron’s proposed fuel-tax increase are animated not by utopia but by despair.
In this sense, the Yellow Vest uprising is not unlike a French Brexit, in that it amounts to an act of shooting oneself in the foot.
Whereas the British resorted to the ballot box, the French have adopted a mixture of barricades, marches, and stone throwing.
In either case, everyone seems to lose out.
Just as Great Britain’s break from the European Union will leave both parties diminished, France’s domestic upheaval could undercut European integration.
Under Macron, France was supposed to keep the flame of liberal democracy alive in a world darkened by Donald Trump’s America, Viktor Orbán’s Hungary, and Matteo Salvini’s Italy.
With German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s own leadership slipping, France looked like an island of hope in a sea of Western despair.
That is clearly no longer the case.
One senses in British and American media coverage of the Yellow Vest protests a degree of schadenfreude.
The proud nation with the arrogant leader has been knocked down a peg; it turns out that the French are no different from anyone else.
The Yellow Vest revolt has been driven in part by Macron’s mistakes.
In pursuing radical but necessary reforms, he has been counting on stronger economic growth to vindicate him.
But growth has not materialized, and that makes an ecologically motivated fuel tax impossible for middle- and lower-class French commuters to accept.
Making matters worse, Macron launched his reform agenda by slashing France’s wealth tax, a move that won him the sobriquet “President of the Rich.”
Yet, because Macron had cut himself off from the country’s “corps intermédiaires” – including mayors, regional representatives, and trade unions – it took him far too long to see that the anger in France’s provinces, small towns, and rural areas was coming to a boil.
By surrounding himself with a court of bright young technocrats, Macron lost contact with what he calls “his people” (a rather tone-deaf formulation in itself).
This is a longstanding problem with the French meritocracy.
When I was teaching at the National School of Administration in the 1980s, I saw the “happy few” who had passed the school’s highly selective entry exams being awarded their own cars and personal drivers.
Imagine receiving this treatment as a 20-year-old intern in one of France’s Prefectures.
No wonder they operate as if the state is at their service, rather than the other way around.
Macron’s own personality may also have been a decisive factor in this first major crisis of his presidency.
Macron is an exceptionally intelligent, energetic, and courageous person, but he seems to lack the maturity and humility that come with age.
He was so eager to restore to the French presidency the dignity that had been lost under his two predecessors – Nicolas Sarkozy and François Hollande – that he went too far in the opposite direction.
If you want to impress Russian President Vladimir Putin or other foreign dignitaries, hosting them in such a magisterial setting as Versailles is sure to prove effective.
But reveling in the country’s monarchical history can be dangerous.
Many of those who voted for Macron may have been hoping for a twenty-first-century Bonaparte. But now they may be thinking more of Louis XVI, the king who paid with his life for the faults of his predecessors.
Can Macron learn from his mistakes and regain the confidence of French voters who have felt humiliated by him?
It will not be easy, but it is not impossible.
At any rate, one should not write off prematurely a politician of such vision and ambition.
Rather than rejoicing in a bold leader’s comeuppance, those who still believe in democracy should be thinking about what it would mean if Macron fails.
Italy’s present would become France’s future, and the populists who come to power in Paris would probably put an end to the entire European project.
That is not an outcome anyone should wish for.
For better or worse, Macron still represents European democracy’s best bulwark against a wave of populist nationalism.

Did US Drone Strikes Lose Yemen?
NEW YORK – Recent revelations that the US killed an innocent American in a drone strike in Pakistan confirm what a new study, “Death by Drone,” of civilian harm caused by US drone strikes in Yemen shows – that claims about the precision of drone strikes are overstated.
The revelations also underscore the stark asymmetry between how the US treats drone strikes that kill its own citizens and those that kill others. While the Obama administration has now publicly acknowledged that it has recently killed three US citizens in drone strikes, it has refused to acknowledge countless other drone strikes around the world which have killed non-US civilians.
In Yemen, the US has been conducting drone strikes since at least 2002, with estimates of the total number of strikes ranging from 91 to 203.
While the American and Yemeni governments have lauded the drones’ precise targeting, they have refused to meaningfully disclose key details about the strikes, including how many have been conducted, who has been targeted, or, crucially, the number and identities of civilians killed.
In a May 2013 speech at the National Defense University, Obama offered assurances that, outside the Afghan war theater, no drone strike would be carried out unless there was “near-certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured.”
Obama also claimed that the US targets only “terrorists who pose a continuing and imminent threat to the American people,” and that it does not launch drone strikes when it has “the ability to capture individual terrorists.”
“Death by Drone,” which includes first-hand testimony from eyewitnesses and survivors of drone strikes in Yemen, tells a different story.
The nine case studies documented in the report, four of which cover attacks that came after the 2013 speech, provide credible evidence that US drone strikes have killed and injured Yemeni civilians, suggesting that the “near-certainty” standard is not being effectively implemented.
The report also casts doubt on Obama’s other claims, with evidence indicating that targets of drone strikes, though perhaps posing a threat to Yemen, may not have posed a direct threat to the US, and that their capture may have been possible.
In other words, Yemeni civilians have suffered and died from drone strikes that may not have been necessary.
More generally, the report provides a window into the experiences of Yemeni civilians directly affected by US drone strikes.
The testimonies of these individuals, vital for assessing the US drone program, are all too easy to overlook because these individuals are poor and have no political influence, and because the strikes are conducted in secret, far away from the US.

As Yaslem Saeed bin Ishaq, whose son was killed in a US drone strike in Wadi Sir on August 1, 2013, observed, “They just kill.
They do not know what havoc their missiles have caused. They are unaware of the suffering they create for our families.”
Indeed, if the US never acknowledges the specific strikes, how can ordinary Americans possibly know that Rasilah al-Faqih, a pregnant Yemeni woman, was killed in Walad Rabei’, along with her husband and ten-year-old daughter, as they headed home from a visit to the doctor?
Or that Abdoh Mohammed al-Jarraah’s house in Silat al-Jarraah had 19 people, including women and children, inside when it was hit by a US drone strike?
The US’ refusal to acknowledge drone strikes that kill foreigners is sending a damaging message in Yemen and beyond.
As Moqbel Abdullah Ali al-Jarraah, a villager from Silat al-Jarraah, put it: “I believe that America is testing its lethal inventions in our poor villages, because [it] cannot afford to do so at any place where human life has value. Here, we are without value.”
In every incident recorded in this report, the families of Yemeni civilians killed in US strikes want to know why they were targeted.
As the father of Nasser Mohammed Nasser, one of four innocent civilians killed in a US drone strike on April 19, 2014, lamented: “My son and those who were with him had nothing to do with Al Qaeda. They were simply on their way to earn a living.
Why, then, did the American aircraft strike them?”
But the US has given Nasser no answers.
It has not even acknowledged that it killed his son.
In February 2013, then-White House counterterrorism chief John Brennan testified at his Senate confirmation hearing to become CIA Director that, “in the interest of transparency,” the US must acknowledge mistaken killings publicly.
Later that month, he recognized that the US government “should make public the overall numbers of civilian deaths resulting from US strikes targeting Al Qaeda.” The US has done neither.
It should come as no surprise, then, that civilians like Nasser, who have lost mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters in US strikes, are outraged not only at the US, but also at the Yemeni government, which consented to the attacks.
They believe that instead of making Yemen and the US safer, drone strikes only strengthen support for Al Qaeda.
Earlier this year, the US announced a new policy for drone exports, purportedly part of a broader effort to work with other countries to “shape international standards” on the use of drones and compel recipient states “to use these systems in accordance with international law.”
But, as “Death by Drone” shows, the US drone program is fundamentally flawed and should not be perpetuated. The Obama administration’s recent admissions that its drone strikes killed its own citizens only underscore this fact.

Can Yemen Be Saved?
SANA'A – Yemen is no stranger to crisis. Exposed to a regional proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia, plagued by an entrenched Al Qaeda affiliate, and divided by tribal disputes and a secession movement, the country has become a poster child for everything that can go wrong in the Arab world.
Yemen has demonstrated remarkable resiliency in the past.
To ensure that the recent overthrow of its government by the Shia Houthi rebel movement does not deal Yemen the lethal blow that it has avoided so far, the international community must not abandon the country in what may be its hour of greatest need.
The origins of the Houthi movement date to 1991, when it was created to protect Zaydism, a moderate form of Shi'ism, from the encroachment of Sunni Islamists.
After the attacks on New York and Washington, DC, on September 11, 2001, the group's battle took on a geopolitical dimension, as its fighters objected to Yemen's decision to collaborate with the United States and enhance bilateral intelligence cooperation.
From 2004 to 2010, the group fought six wars against the Yemeni government and even skirmished with Saudi Arabia.
Yet it never managed to expand its reach beyond its stronghold in the north of the country.
That changed in 2011, when the popular protests and political chaos stemming from the Arab Spring led to widespread institutional paralysis, allowing the Houthis to march past a military that largely refused to fight it.
The group's power grab has frightened its adversaries, leading them to seek new alliances that could imperil the state's security.
In the central region of Marib, home to the oil and gas facilities that Yemen relies on for foreign currency, several tribes have vowed to fight the Houthis.
The region was once a stronghold of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), an affiliate of the global terrorist organization.
If the military refuses to assist the tribes – as is likely – they may be tempted to turn to AQAP.
The situation is no less precarious in the southern provinces, where a secession movement has been active since 2007.
Southerners are up in arms because the Houthi rebellion halted plans for the adoption of a federal system, which would have given the region greater autonomy.
In response, armed groups seized checkpoints and closed the port of Aden.
The risk of secession is very real.
Southern Sunnis have been marginalized since a 1994 civil war that left northerners in control of most of the country's political institutions.
Many in the region worry that the Houthis will discriminate against them further.
AQAP is firmly rooted in this region as well, implying the possibility that local residents will seek its help in defending against an expected Houthi onslaught.
Meanwhile, Yemen continues to serve as a battleground in a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia.
Iran has armed and trained the Houthis, and, though the rebels' brand of Shi'ism shares little with that practiced in Tehran, they have praised the Islamic Republic's founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and held up Iran's Lebanese proxy, Hezbollah, as a model to be emulated.
When the Houthis took over Sana'a, the capital, in September, Saudi Arabia cut off aid to the country.
To make matters worse, falling oil prices and attacks on pipelines imperil a hydrocarbon industry that provides 63% of government revenues.
Decreased earnings led Yemen to forecast a $3.2 billion budget deficit last year.
If the turmoil is not curtailed and the Saudis do not resume the payments that have long ensured the country's ability to function, Yemen may not be able to cover its expenditures.
The US has followed Saudi Arabia's lead, shuttering its embassy and freezing intelligence cooperation and counterterrorism operations.
This is a mistake. Yemen's military is largely intact, having remained in its barracks as the Houthis marched to the capital, and there is little evidence that the units that work with the Americans are loyal to the new rebel government.
Suspending cooperation risks giving AQAP free rein in a country where it was able to wreak havoc even when bridled.
Yemen is mired in crises that it cannot solve alone.
Unless its international allies throw it a lifeline, it risks being swallowed by a sea of disorder that could imperil the entire region.

Yemen’s Regime Change Gets Personal
SANAA – When Yemen’s President Ali Abdullah Saleh ordered his military on March 18 to fire on peaceful protesters calling for his resignation, he sealed his fate.
A wave of military, government, and diplomatic defections, led by his long-time ally First Armored Brigade Commander General Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar, rocked his regime.
But, although al-Ahmar announced that he was appalled by the use of force and vowed to defend the constitution, his decision was anything but altruistic.
The disgruntled general, who has long-standing ties to the type of jihadists that the United States is battling in Yemen, merely sought to settle a score with the president’s family.
The relationship between al-Ahmar and Saleh extends to their youth, with Saleh’s mother having had a second marriage to al-Ahmar’s uncle.
Though they are not half-brothers, this frequent, if mistaken reference, indicates their closeness.
Al-Ahmar has long been considered either Saleh’s right hand man or the country’s hidden president.
When the Nasserite party attempted to overthrow Saleh less than 100 days into his presidency, al-Ahmar defended him and quashed the coup.
In 1994, his units put down a secessionist movement in the south.
But, as Saleh prepared the way for his son Ahmad – the head of the Presidential Guard – to succeed him, he began to marginalize al-Ahmar.
In 2009, Saleh sacked al-Ahmar’s key backers, including Central Command Chief General al-Thahiri al-Shadadi and Lieutenant General Haydar al-Sanhani, from power.
Al-Ahmar has also not benefited from the military aid that the US lavished on Yemen in the wake of al-Qaeda’s failed Christmas Day plot in 2009 to down an American airliner.
While the Central Security Service, led by Saleh’s nephew Yahya, has received millions of dollars to fight al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, al-Ahmar has been left out of the economic bonanza.
At the same time, al-Ahmar’s dismal performance in spearheading the war against the Houthi-led sectarian rebellion in the north made him a convenient scapegoat for the regime’s failures.
The regime’s desire to get al-Ahmar out of the picture became clear during the last round of fighting aginst the Houthis in 2009-2010, when Saudi Arabia began bombing the rebels.
According to a US diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks, Yemeni officials gave the Saudis the coordinates for al-Ahmar’s command center, telling them that it was a Houthi camp.
His relationship with Saleh frayed and his influence waning, al-Ahmar understood that his loyalty to Saleh had become a liability.
So his decision to abandon Saleh stemmed less from his love of the constitution and democracy than from his desire to even the score with the president and his son Ahmad Saleh, with whom he has long clashed.
Their units skirmished during the Houthi campaign, and the two engaged in a power struggle over defense of the radio and television stations.
Saleh won at the time, but today al-Ahmar’s troops have control.
Al-Ahmar’s relationship with jihadists is a source of serious concern.
He is married to the sister of Tariq al-Fadhli, a Yemeni who fought alongside al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Ladin in Afghanistan.
When more than 4,000 Arabs returned from fighting the Soviets there, al-Ahmar organized them into units and deployed them in the 1994 civil war.
One jihadist who trained in al-Qaeda’s camps, and met bin Ladin, told me that upon his return from Afghanistan, he was invited to meet al-Ahmar’s associates and was given a monthly stipend.
During a 1999 trial of Yemenis convicted of kidnapping 16 Europeans, it emerged that the group’s ringleader called al-Ahmar during the ordeal.
Though his ties to jihadists may be expedient rather than ideological, they are deeply worrying.
Today, Saleh’s support among his top generals is dwindling.
Of Yemen’s four regional commanders, only Southern Command Chief General Mahdi Maqwala still backs him.
Lesser lieutenant generals have deserted the president in droves.
The fate of the country may not hinge on Saleh, a crafty veteran who knows that his career is over. But his son Ahmad, who is less politically astute, may yet seek to settle accounts with al-Ahmar.
His forces have already clashed with rival units in Mukalla and surrounded the presidential palace in Aden.
If the Salehs retain control of the air force, which remains under the control of Saleh’s half-brother, employing it against defecting military divisions would likely lead to a bloodbath.
Nevertheless, the doomsday scenarios predicting anarchy and chaos in the post-Saleh era are most likely exaggerated.
Unlike in Egypt, the vacuum resulting from Saleh’s departure can be quickly filled, so the country need not fall back on a military oligarchy.
The Yemeni opposition is not only organized, but also plays an active role in politics and has true grassroots support.
And, unlike in Egypt, where the ruling party was detested and out of touch with the masses, Yemen’s General People’s Congress has some following in society.
If Saleh leaves peacefully and represses the urge to unleash the last remaining loyal army units against protesters and defecting soldiers, the country can avert Libya-like mayhem.
Indeed, the opposition parties have already organized a transitional council to take Saleh’s place.
With the sun quickly setting on the Saleh era, the president is out of options.
The only decision before him and his thinning ranks of allies is whether to leave peacefully or go down fighting.

Women’s Development Goals
NEW YORK – As the 2015 deadline for the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) approaches, world leaders will face a choice: move the goal posts back another decade or two, or hold accountable those who have failed to deliver on their commitments.
For women, the choice is clear.
We have been here before.
In 1978, at the International Conference on Primary Health Care in Alma-Ata, 134 states signed a declaration calling for adequate health care for all by the year 2000.
Sixteen years later, in 1994, in Cairo, 179 governments embraced reproductive rights as a basic human right and adopted resolutions to ensure the provision of universal access to a full range of reproductive health services, including family planning.
Yet those deadlines had come and gone when, in September 2000, during the 55th UN General Assembly, leaders of 189 nations adopted the MDGs.
And several other commitments and resolutions were undertaken by world leaders before and after the MDG declaration.
So, where are we now?
We know that several MDG targets have already been met.
Extreme poverty has been more than halved since 2000, to about 22% in 2010 – taking almost 700 million people out of the ranks of the world’s poorest.
We have seen positive results in the fight against HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis.
Billions of people have access to improved drinking water; and many have gained access to sanitation (though a billion people still have to resort to open defecation – a major health risk).
There has also been progress on gender equality.
Girls and boys attend school in equal numbers, and women are increasingly making themselves heard in the political arena.
But the picture quickly becomes cloudy.
Though chronic under-nutrition among young children has declined, one in four children – 162 million children, according to the World Health Organization – are still affected by stunting.
Indeed, maternal and child mortality has decreased by millions, but many of these preventable deaths are still claiming the lives of hundreds of thousands of women and children each year.
Moreover, the UN Foundation reports that 222 million women still cannot access the most basic information, products, and services that would enable them to decide how many children to have and to time their pregnancies in ways that preserve their health, enable them to pursue an education, and improve their lives.
The same report notes that more than 300,000 girls and women aged 15-19 die every year from pregnancy-related complications, while many more are left to deal with debilitating disabilities.
The UN secretary-general’s 2013 report “A Life of Dignity for All” calls for a universal agenda to ensure that no one is left behind.
But millions of people – and particularly women – already are being left behind.
And, because world leaders and their development partners have failed to meet women’s basic reproductive-health needs once again, it will be more difficult to achieve concrete progress toward realizing the agenda for sustainable development.
The UN’s own calls to accelerate momentum at the launch of the 500-day countdown to the MDGs’ expiry highlight the fact that inequality, maternal mortality from childbirth, lack of universal education, and environmental degradation remain serious challenges.
To truly affect change – and not only for women – we need global support for access to family planning, women’s and children’s health services, and support for empowerment initiatives.
An educated woman is better able to take care of herself, make informed choices, and broaden her contribution to her community.
When we leave women behind, we leave their communities behind, too.
No one disputes that development must be inclusive and equitable.
What is missing from the diplomatic discourse is a strong framework to hold governments and development partners accountable for translating lofty ideals like human rights – particularly the right to access basic health and social services – into practical solutions.
As the post-2015 sustainable development agenda is drafted, world leaders and their development partners need to think beyond setting new goals or targets that fade with time, and move toward establishing accountability mechanisms, processes, and systems to ensure that we meet the goals that we have already set.
We must break away from the current unwritten code of “zero accountability” for leaders who fail to honor their own commitments to internationally agreed goals.
In short, our governments must begin to do what they have promised.
Without strong accountability mechanisms, ending preventable maternal deaths and fostering sustainable and equitable development will continue to elude us as we move into increasingly perilous times.

Can Ukraine Be Saved?
KYIV – Acrid black smoke hangs in the air and stings the eye in much of central Kyiv, where state repression is dampening hope of resolving Ukraine’s political crisis.
With a truce between the government and the opposition shattered only hours after it came into effect, and with dozens of people reported killed in recent days, any hope for an end to the country’s deepening civil disorder appears to be fading fast.
Yes, a tentative settlement has been reached, following mediation by European Union foreign ministers, with a promise of early elections.
But such settlements have been proposed before, and no agreement is likely to gain broad acceptance unless it includes the immediate departure of President Viktor Yanukovych.
In fact, Yanukovych’s government seems prepared to use any and all measures to remain in power.
Taking a page from Russian President Vladimir Putin’s playbook, tax police are prosecuting civil-society organizations in the hope of cowing them into silence and irrelevance.
Yet, despite such intimidation, Ukrainians from all walks of life have been protesting for three months in cities across the country.
At its heart, this is a struggle between Ukraine’s European-oriented West and its Russian-fixated East for the country’s geopolitical soul.
Will Ukraine move closer to the European Union or instead join the Russian-dominated Eurasian Union?
Despite the mounting violence, Ukraine is not on the verge of civil war – at least not yet.
But make no mistake: the risk of the country – and its military – splintering is very real, as Yanukovych’s decision to sack Volodymyr Zamana, the head of the armed forces, attests.
The conflict needs to be stopped now.
To achieve that, Ukraine needs a transitional government of experts and a new constitution that returns the country to the system that prevailed until a decade ago, with power divided between Parliament and the president.
Moreover, a presidential election should be held within three months, with a new parliament voted in soon after.
But Yanukovych has shown that he does not want a negotiated solution.
Until the recent surge in violence, it seemed that dialogue might defuse tensions.
An amnesty for detained protesters was offered, and protesters agreed to withdraw from government buildings.
But when demonstrators fulfilled their promise and evacuated occupied buildings, Yanukovych resorted to force in an effort to end the protests altogether.
Indeed, the police began firing into crowds of demonstrators, and have reportedly killed at least 70 and injured hundreds more.
Hospitals are overflowing, and many people are avoiding state clinics, because they are afraid of being detained – or worse.
The activist Yuri Verbitsky, a mathematical physicist, was abducted by five men in late January from a Kyiv hospital, where he had gone to seek treatment after being injured by a stun grenade at a demonstration.
Verbitsky’s battered body was found the next day in a forest outside the city.
Any prospect for resolving the crisis ultimately depends on regaining citizens’ trust in their police and security forces, which are now viewed by many as an occupying force.
To reestablish the public’s confidence, there can be no impunity for those who fired bullets or gave the orders to fire.
Officials’ excessive use of force, and the government’s reliance on semi-criminal thugs (known as titushki) to attack protesters, must be thoroughly investigated.
But, even as the ongoing violence makes such an investigation all the more urgent, Ukraine’s prosecutor and courts refuse to act.
That is why it is crucial that a high-level international mission – comprising civil-society leaders, the Council of Europe, and the European Union – launch a comprehensive inquiry and pressure Ukraine’s government to cooperate.
The EU and the United States have introduced diplomatic sanctions since the latest round of murderous violence began.
This should include a travel ban not only on all officials who ordered, oversaw, or implemented the crackdown, but also on Yanukovych’s political enablers: the oligarchs who are now sitting on the sidelines while spiriting large sums of money out of the country.
Sanctions should be lifted only when a credible investigation into the last three months of violence is permitted and a technocratic government is in place (at which point the EU and its member states should offer concrete economic assistance).
Prime Minister Mykola Azarov resigned last month, ostensibly to make way for such a solution.
But Yanukovych has refused to take the next step, or to commit to constitutional reforms, which largely explains the protesters’ growing frustration – and their determination to press ahead in the face of brutal repression.
There is a perception in the West that all of Ukraine’s political forces are weak, divided, and corrupt.
And there are growing concerns, often fueled by sensationalist media coverage, that far-right forces are gaining the upper hand within the opposition camp.
But, though such forces do exist, the vast majority of demonstrators on the Maidans across the country are ordinary people angry about abuse of power, state violence, official impunity, and corruption.
For the venal and vicious elites who have taken control of Ukraine, the real threat is these demonstrators’ perseverance, not the provocations of a radical fringe.
Indeed, while I refuse to believe that Ukraine’s march to civil war is unstoppable, I also know that our citizens will never be silenced again.

Filling the Global Leadership Vacuum
SEOUL – Has the world entered a new era of chaos?
America’s vacillating policy toward Syria certainly suggests so.
Indeed, the bitter legacy of the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, followed by the 2008 financial crisis, has made the United States not only reluctant to use its military might, even when “red lines” are crossed, but also seemingly unwilling to bear any serious burden to maintain its global leadership position.
But, if America is no longer willing to lead, who will take its place?
China’s leaders have demonstrated their lack of interest in active global leadership by openly rejecting calls to become a “responsible stakeholder” in the international political and economic systems.
Meanwhile, though Russia may wish to maintain the illusion that it is a global power, it lately seems interested primarily in thwarting America whenever possible – even when doing so is not in its own long-term interests.
And Europe faces too many internal problems to assume any significant leadership role in global affairs.
Unsurprisingly, this dearth of leadership has seriously undermined the effectiveness of international institutions, exemplified by the United Nations Security Council’s ineffectual response to the Syria crisis and the failure of the current round of World Trade Organization (WTO) trade negotiations.
This situation resembles the 1930’s – a decade when, as the economic historian Charles P. Kindleberger argued, a leadership vacuum led to the under-production of global public goods, deepening the Great Depression.
In these circumstances, the US and China – the only viable candidates for global leadership – must achieve a grand compromise that reconciles their fundamental interests, in turn enabling them to act in concert to provide and protect global public goods.
Only by stabilizing the bilateral Sino-American relationship can a global system that supports peace and shared prosperity be achieved.
Such a compromise should begin with a concerted effort by the US to enhance China’s role in international economic institutions like the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the WTO.
While the appointment of the Chinese central banker Zhu Min as IMF Deputy Managing Director was a positive step, it has not been followed by other appointments or steps that would increase China’s influence.
Moreover, China should be included in the Trans-Pacific Partnership – the pan-Asian free-trade area that the US is now negotiating with Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam.
Dividing the Asia-Pacific region into two economic blocs – one centered around China and the other around the US – will increase mistrust and encourage economic friction.
In fact, as former US National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski argued at the World Peace Forum in Beijing in June, what the world really needs is a comprehensive economic partnership between the US and China.
But such cooperation will be impossible unless the US recognizes China as an equal partner – and not just rhetorically.
Given that the US retains a significant military advantage over China, America could support such a partnership without incurring significant security risks.
The irony is that military superiority could weaken US leaders’ willingness to make the kinds of concessions, particularly with regard to security matters, that an equal partnership would require.
But, even then, the needed adjustments could be made without compromising US security interests.
Consider US arms sales to Taiwan.
Given the degree of China-Taiwan cooperation nowadays, reducing such sales would be unlikely to endanger Taiwan, and doing so would contribute substantially to confidence-building between the US and China.
The question is whether any US president, Republican or Democrat, would be willing to risk alienating those who still view Taiwan through the lens of its conflict with the People’s Republic.
The quid quo pro for these changes to US policy would be a commitment by China to respect and defend a set of international norms, principles, and institutions that was created largely without its involvement.
Given that China’s rapid GDP growth since 1979 would have been impossible without America’s efforts to create an open world order, Chinese leaders should not consider this too difficult a pill to swallow.
To be sure, China’s increasingly assertive foreign policy since 2009 could indicate that, despite the universal advantages that a Sino-American leadership condominium would bring, its leaders will remain unwilling to commit to enforcing the existing global order.
But the growing sense that this new assertiveness has backfired, increasing anxiety among China’s neighbors and compelling the US to ramp up its strategic involvement in Asia, means that China could probably be convinced to reset its relationship with the US. The major test here will be whether China is willing to accept the status quo in the East and South China Seas.
Doomsayers frequently cite the wars that followed Imperial Germany’s rise as a historical parallel to the Sino-American relationship today.
But a better example – in which a global hegemon accommodates an emerging power – might be the United Kingdom’s acceptance of America’s rise.
As China’s leaders define the country’s global role, they should bear in mind the success of the UK’s approach – as well as the failure of Imperial Germany’s arrogant diplomacy.

Asia’s Military Revolution
SEOUL – A vast revolution in military affairs is taking place across East Asia.
The latest signs are Chinese President Xi Jinping’s purge of General Xu Caihou, an ex-Politburo member and former vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, on charges of corruption, and Japan’s “reinterpretation” of Article 9 of its constitution to permit the country to provide military aid to its allies.
Despite the rising regional tensions that inspired these moves, China’s relations with its neighbors and the United States are not fated to lead to direct confrontation.
But the relentless march of new initiatives to meet the perceived “China threat” will require the region’s political leaders, including the Chinese, to address their disputes in new and more creative ways if that outcome is to be avoided.
In general, there are three ways to foster international peace: deepening economic interdependence, promoting democracy, and building international institutions.
Unfortunately, because East Asia’s political leaders have failed to pursue the latter objective, they now find themselves playing dangerous balance-of-power games reminiscent of Europe a century ago.
Deepening economic interdependence in the wake of Asia’s 1997 financial crisis has not generated political momentum for peace and cooperation.
The region’s business leaders have been unable to prevent deteriorating foreign relations from harming their interests.
By contrast, military lobbying now deeply influences foreign and defense policies – witness China’s double-digit increase in defense spending and rising US arms sales in the region.
What explains this failure?
International-relations theorists since Immanuel Kant have held that democracies rarely (if ever) fight one another; as a result, political leaders, such as US President Woodrow Wilson, have tried to promote democracy as a means to spread peace.
Until recently, the US seemed to have assumed that China’s engagement with Western democracies would bolster peaceful ties.
But, since the 2008 financial crisis, China’s confidence in its authoritarian development model has grown stronger.
Its leaders now increasingly appear to believe that a new “Beijing Consensus” of mercantilism and state intervention has replaced the old “Washington Consensus” of free trade and deregulation.
China’s ideological incompatibility with the US thus is making the shift in their relative power difficult to achieve peacefully.
In the late nineteenth century, a rising US was able to cooperate with a declining Britain, owing to their shared culture and values.
China’s leaders, however, tend to suspect that the US is deliberately trying to undermine their country’s political stability by questioning its record on human rights and political freedoms.
Meanwhile, Xi’s domestic policies seem to be taking the country ever further from Western norms.
It is this ideological divide that is undermining the development in East Asia of institutions that establish principles, rules, and decision-making procedures for the region.
While much of the West is bound together by institutions like the Organization for Security Cooperation in Europe and NATO, East Asia’s main body, the ASEAN Regional Forum, is too weak to play an analogous role, leaving the region beset with unregulated rivalries.
So far, US and East Asian leaders have done little beyond offering rhetorical support for the creation of multilateral security institutions.
With the exception of the almost defunct six-party talks aimed at eliminating the nuclear threat posed by North Korea, Asia’s powers refuse to be constrained by international rules or norms.
Instead, East Asia’s leaders resort to realpolitik.
Unfortunately, unlike Europe’s nineteenth-century political masterminds – figures like Talleyrand, Metternich, Bismarck, and Disraeli – who crafted durable international alliances, Asia lacks leaders willing and able to look beyond their narrow national interests.
For example, China’s leaders seem to believe that the 2008 economic crisis and the high costs of two foreign wars have left the US in no position to exercise international leadership.
That may explain China’s recent foreign-policy assertiveness, particularly in its dispute with Japan over control of the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, which could be intended to probe the strength of the US-Japan alliance.
Testing US power in this way could prove to be a dangerous miscalculation.
Though weakened economically, the US remains a military superpower.
Its interests in East Asia date back to the late nineteenth century.
Just as Britain refused to concede naval supremacy to Germany a century ago, the US will not easily accept any Chinese challenge to its strategic position in the western Pacific, especially given that so many East Asian states are pleading for US protection.
China and the US need to talk.
Despite their economic interdependence and some 90 inter-governmental channels for bilateral dialogue, the two superpowers are caught in a perilous tug-of-war over interests in the East and South China Seas and the western Pacific.
Sino-Japanese relations are particularly fraught, with two decades of economic stagnation in Japan and rapid growth in China fueling nationalist overreaction on both sides.
Having become accustomed to outsourcing its security to the US, and despite having the world’s third-largest economy, Japan neglected to develop its own constructive diplomatic vision.
It remains to be seen whether Abe’s constitutional reinterpretation, cloaked in the language of regional cooperation, advances such a new vision.
It does not help that the US wants Japan to shoulder more of the burden of maintaining Asia’s security, a position that may make sense strategically and financially, but that betrays a lack of understanding of the political context.
The US seems to underestimate regional concerns over Japan’s potential remilitarization.
By providing Japan with a diplomatic carte blanche, the US may find itself hostage to Japanese interests, with the result that Japan becomes part of Asia’s security problem, not part of its solution.
Asia-Pacific leaders must shake off their complacency.
Serious efforts and far-reaching compromises are needed to begin the process of building institutions for regional security cooperation.
Otherwise, the much-heralded “Asian century,” far from bringing economic prosperity and peace, will be an age of suspicion and peril.

The Politics of Young and Old
PARIS – If one considers some of today’s main challenges – including climate change, pensions, public debt, and the labor market – an obvious conclusion emerges: It is relatively much worse to be young today than it was a quarter-century ago.
Yet in most countries, the generational dimension is remarkably absent from the political debate.
Fifty years ago, people spoke often, and loudly, of a “generation gap.”
Today, that gap has become invisible.
This is bad for the young, for democracy, and for social justice.
Start with climate change.
Its containment requires changing habits and investing in emission reductions so that future generations will have a habitable planet.
The alarm bell was first rung in 1992 at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro; but over the last generation, little was done to contain emissions.
And progress following the landmark agreement achieved in Paris in December is unlikely to be fast, because the accord is premised on postponing major efforts.
Universal assent was made possible only by further delaying.
Given the massive inertia inherent in the greenhouse effect, the gap between responsible and irresponsible behavior will start resulting in different temperatures only in a quarter-century, and major consequences will follow only in 50 years.
Anyone older than 60 today will hardly notice the difference between the two scenarios.
But the fate of most citizens currently younger than 30 will be fundamentally affected.
In due course, the respite gained by the older generations will have to be paid for by the younger ones.
Now consider debt.
Since 1990, public debt has increased by about 40 percentage points of GDP in the European Union and the United States (and much more in Japan).
Given near-zero interest rates, the corresponding drag on income is currently low; but, because inflation is virtually inexistent and growth is anemic, the debt ratios have only stabilized.
So debt reduction will take longer than expected in the aftermath of the global crisis, which will deprive the coming generations of the fiscal space they might need to invest in climate action or in the containment of security threats.
Future pensions represent another form of debt.
The pay-as-you-go (PAYG) systems in place in many countries are giant intergenerational transfer schemes.
True, everyone is expected to contribute while they work, before becoming a recipient in retirement.
In an ideal steady state, pension regimes would not redistribute income across cohorts born at different points in time.
As specialists say, they would be generationally neutral.
But the baby boomers (those born from the mid-1940s to the mid-1960s) paid little into the PAYG schemes because economic growth, population size, and their parents’ low life expectancy made financing pensions easy.
All these factors have now gone into reverse: Growth has slowed, the baby boomers are a demographic bulge weighing on their children, and they are expected to live long.
Countries where pension reforms were introduced early have been able to limit the resulting burden on the young and keep the balance between generations approximately fair.
But countries where reforms were delayed have allowed that balance to place the young at a disadvantage.
Finally, consider the labor market.
Over the last decade, conditions for new entrants have worsened markedly in many countries.
The number of young people categorized as NEET (neither in employment nor in education or training) currently stands at 10.2 million in the US and 14 million in the EU.
Furthermore, many of those who have recently entered the labor market have suffered from job insecurity and repeated spells of unemployment.
In continental Europe, especially, young workers are the first to suffer from economic downturns.
On all of these issues – climate, debt, pensions, and jobs – the younger generations have been made relatively worse off by developments over the last quarter-century.
A telling symbol is that there is often more poverty among the young than among the elderly.
This ought to be a major political issue, with significant implications for public finances, social protection, tax policy, and labor market regulation.
And it reinforces the imperative of reviving growth through productivity-boosting policies.
Yet the new generation gap has had little direct political effect.
It hardly arises in electoral debate and has generally not led to the emergence of new parties or movements.
Instead, the generational divide shows up in electoral participation.
In the latest US mid-term elections, the turnout rate among younger citizens was less than 20%, compared to more than 50% for senior voters.
Similar trends are observable in other countries.
Despite the increased uncertainty they face, younger citizens are much more disengaged from electoral politics than their parents and grandparents were at the same age.
This generational gap in electoral participation explains why politicians care more about the elderly than about the young.
But in aging societies, the more the young abstain from voting, the more decisions by parliaments and governments will be biased against their interests.
True, parents are generally not selfish. They help their children through private transfers and grants.
But only those with income and wealth can provide meaningful support.
The result of neglecting young people collectively while supporting them privately is social inequality on a massive scale.
How to redress generational biases in the political system is a key question for all democracies.
Solutions do exist: mandatory voting, term limits for elected officials, and youth parliaments or special bodies to examine intergenerational issues, for example.
But such measures are either difficult to implement or only moderately effective in view of the magnitude of the challenges.
Current trends are clearly unsustainable politically and socially.
What is unclear is when and how young people will recognize that and make themselves heard.

Your Genes or Mine, How Different Are We?
For some time, scientists have believed that individual human beings were 99.9% genetically identical.
The 0.1% of the genome that was different (approximately 3,000,000 bases of DNA) was comprised of “single nucleotide polymorphisms” (SNPs are alterations of the individual bases of DNA) scattered throughout the genome.
It was thought that some of these DNA alterations may in part explain some of the physical differences that exist between two different, but otherwise normal individuals.
In the summer of 2004, two groups of scientists working independently (one led by researchers at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and the other led by researchers at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories) called this scientific dogma into question.
Their research identified hundreds of regions of the human genome where the number of copies of a particular DNA segment varied from individual to individual.
With only a few exceptions, all DNA segments were thought to exist in two copies (one copy inherited from your mother and one copy inherited from your father).
Both studies showed that there are hundreds of regions of the genome that could have more or less than the expected two copies.
This alerted scientists to the existence of a larger source of genetic variation than was previously understood, and forced us to speculate on the implications of this discovery.
This discovery was made recently because until now, the technology was not available to comprehensively assess genomic imbalances in a genome-wide fashion.
That has changed over the last five or six years, with the development of a technique known as “array-based comparative genomic hybridization” (array-CGH), revolutionizing genetic research and diagnostics.
About three years ago at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, when we were seeking a potential tool for high-resolution diagnostics, array-CGH offered the hope of providing a reliable and efficient genome-wide test that could detect gains or losses in an unbiased and non-subjective fashion.
When validation experiments were performed that compared the DNA from one “normal, healthy” individual with the DNA from another “normal, healthy” individual, we were astonished to find an average of 12 DNA fragments that showed copy number differences between the two individuals being compared.
These became known as copy number variants, or CNVs.
Combining the data from our study and the study from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, over 300 regions of the genome were found to exhibit CNVs among normal individuals.
Since these two initial studies, many other groups, including ours, have confirmed and documented many more CNVs in other individuals studied.
This is the goal of the Structural Genomic Variation Consortium’s Copy Number Variation Project, which aims at providing researchers the most comprehensive list and characterization of CNVs in humans.
The Consortium recently assessed 270 individuals from four populations with ancestry in Africa, Asia or Europe (known as the HapMap collection) to construct a new map of the human genome.
Using two complementary genome-wide technologies, with subsequent validation studies, a total of 1,447 CNVs were identified.
The data clearly demonstrate that individuals are not as genetically similar as once thought.
Many of the regions in which the CNVs were identified overlapped known disease genes.
Since they are being identified in normal individuals, CNVs may not necessarily be a direct cause of human disease, but many may confer susceptibility to certain diseases, serve as disease markers, and/or indicate potential regions of genomic instability.
Some CNVs are also associated with genes involved in immune response and detoxification-related metabolism (some of the human body’s reactions to the environment that we live in).
Indeed, some CNVs may turn out to explain why some people react differently to specific medications.
Hopefully, a more comprehensive understanding of human genetic variation (i.e. single base pair changes and structural genomic variation, such as CNVs) will ultimately help physicians to prescribe medication in a more individualized manner, that would result in maximum therapeutic effects to each patient, with minimal side effects.
Overall, we anticipate that many of these CNVs will provide explanations to how we adapt and interact with our ever-changing environment.
Indeed, as studies continue to identify and characterize CNVs, we anticipate achieving a better understanding of the relationship between these genetic variations, complex diseases, and human adaptability.

Unburdening the Facebook Generation
LOS ANGELES – Once again, young people have gotten the short end of the political stick.
The outcome of the United Kingdom’s Brexit referendum is but another reminder of a yawning generational divide that cuts across political affiliation, income levels, and race.
Almost 75% of UK voters aged 18-24 voted to “Remain” in the European Union, only to have “Leave” imposed on them by older voters.
And this is just one of several ways in which millennials’ economic future, and that of their children, is being determined by others.
I am in my late fifties, and I worry that our generation in the advanced world will be remembered – to our shame and chagrin – as the one that lost the economic plot.
In the run-up to the 2008 global financial crisis, we feasted on leverage, feeling increasingly entitled to use credit to live beyond our means and to assume too much speculative financial risk.
We stopped investing in genuine engines of growth, letting our infrastructure decay, our education system lag, and our worker training and retooling programs erode.
We allowed the budget to be taken hostage by special interests, which has resulted in a fragmentation of the tax system that, no surprise, has imparted yet another unfair anti-growth bias to the economic system.
And we witnessed a dramatic worsening in inequality, not just of income and wealth, but also of opportunity.
The 2008 crisis should have been our economic wake-up call.
It wasn’t.
Rather than using the crisis to catalyze change, we essentially rolled over and went back to doing more of the same.
Specifically, we simply exchanged private factories of credit and leverage for public ones.
We swapped an over-leveraged banking system for experimental liquidity injections by hyperactive monetary authorities.
In the process, we overburdened central banks, risking their credibility and political autonomy, as well as future financial stability.
Emerging from the crisis, we shifted private liabilities from banks’ balance sheets to taxpayers, including future ones, yet we failed to fix fully the bailed-out financial sector.
We let inequality worsen, and stood by as too many young people in Europe languished in joblessness, risking a scary transition from unemployment to unemployability.
In short, we didn’t do nearly enough to reinvigorate the engines of sustainable inclusive growth, thereby also weakening potential output and threatening future economic performance.
And we are compounding these serial miscarriages with a grand failure to act on longer-term sustainability, particularly when it comes to the planet and social cohesion.
Poor economics has naturally spilled over into messy politics, as growing segments of the population have lost trust in the political establishment, business elites, and expert opinion.
The resulting political fragmentation, including the rise of fringe and anti-establishment movements, has made it even harder to devise more appropriate economic-policy responses.
To add insult to injury, we are now permitting a regulatory backlash against technological innovations that disrupt entrenched and inefficient industries, and that provide people with greater control over their lives and wellbeing.
Growing restrictions on companies such as Airbnb and Uber hit the young particularly hard, both as producers and as consumers.
If we do not change course soon, subsequent generations will confront self-reinforcing economic, financial, and political tendencies that burden them with too little growth, too much debt, artificially inflated asset prices, and alarming levels of inequality and partisan political polarization.
Fortunately, we are aware of the mounting problem, worried about its consequences, and have a good sense of how to bring about the much-needed pivot.
Given the role of technological innovation, much of which is youth-led, even a small reorientation of policies could have a meaningful and rapid impact on the economy.
Through a more comprehensive policy approach, we could turn a vicious cycle of economic stagnation, social immobility, and market volatility into a virtuous cycle of inclusive growth, genuine financial stability, and greater political coherence.
What is needed, in particular, is simultaneous progress on pro-growth structural reforms, better demand management, addressing pockets of excessive indebtedness, and improving regional and global policy frameworks.
While highly desirable, such changes will materialize only if greater constructive pressure is placed on politicians.
Simply put, few politicians will champion changes that promise longer-term benefits but often come with short-term disruptions.
And the older voters who back them will resist any meaningful erosion of their entitlements – even turning, when they perceive a threat to their interests, to populist politicians and dangerously simplistic solutions such as Brexit.
Sadly, young people have been overly complacent when it comes to political participation, notably on matters that directly affect their wellbeing and that of their children.
Yes, almost three-quarters of young voters backed the UK’s “Remain” campaign.
But only a third of them turned out.
In contrast, the participation rate for those over 65 was more than 80%.
Undoubtedly, the absence of young people at the polls left the decision in the hands of older people, whose preferences and motivations differ, even if innocently.
Millennials have impressively gained a greater say in how they communicate, travel, source and disseminate information, pool their resources, interact with businesses, and much else.
Now they must seek a greater say in electing their political representatives and in holding them accountable.
If they don’t, my generation will – mostly inadvertently – continue to borrow excessively from their future.

Youth Without Work
ROME – Among the many devastating effects of the current global financial crisis, one of the most pernicious in the developed world is the upward trajectory of the unemployment rate for youth, which rose by six percentage points in the OECD area from 2007 to 2009, with Spain experiencing an alarming 42% youth unemployment rate in 2010.
When young people cease to be the engine of an economy, long-run economic growth is endangered, and social unrest becomes a real threat to the democratic political order.
In this sense, Italy represents an extreme case, since even highly skilled young workers, though usually over the age threshold of the youth-unemployment rate (29.5% in the country), are being marginalized.
Nevertheless, understanding this phenomenon and its political consequences sheds light on what other OECD countries might face in the near future.
As one of the fastest aging societies in the world, with an economy and a political system inaccessible to its young people, Italy has all the makings of a gerontocracy.
According to a study by LUISS University, half of the country’s top business leaders and political officials are 60 or older.
Moreover, the national statistical institute, ISTAT, points out that in 2009 about 60% of people aged 18-34 (and 30% among people aged 30-34) were living with their parents as a result of their inability to support themselves.
Two million in the same age range were classified as NEETS (not in employment, education, or training).
The system is slowly cracking, and Italian youth risk becoming the first generation in modern history that is worse off than its predecessors.
It comes as no surprise that 79% of the unemployment generated by the financial crisis is attributable to young, precarious workers.
Even if the country is still far from the radical impulses of “1968,” Italy’s lockout of its young people sets the stage for a generational revolt.
Over the last 30 years, Italy has fallen into an old-age trap – a self-reinforcing mechanism whereby rent-seekers (old people) have used control of the political system to prevent new generations (the most dynamic and innovative part of the population) from getting a slice of the pie.
Young people used to believe that, once old and with access to power, their own welfare would be at least as high as that of previous generations.
Instead, the gerontocracy has simply realized older generations’ dreams of equity and social security at the expense of today’s youth, who have been shouldered with a crushing burden of public debt.
Lavish favors, demographic trends, and the absence of serious family policies guaranteed the demise of the social contract now under threat.
First, high levels of debt will limit both welfare benefits and future governments’ ability to swap favors for votes.
Second, globalization, a low-quality educational system, and weak institutions generate uncertainty and insecurity for young people, thereby threatening Italy’s growth prospects – and thus the prospect that future generations will be compensated in old age for a lifetime of hard work and sacrifice.
The process of escaping the old-age trap, and allowing younger generations to assume their key role in the economy, can be either gradual and relatively smooth, or abrupt and relatively traumatic.
In the former case, politicians implement structural reforms aimed at redistributing costs and benefits among generations.
In the latter case, we face an inter-generational clash.
This situation resembles that of declining organizations, as described in Albert O. Hirschman’s seminal treatise Exit, Voice, and Loyalty.
When the quality of an institution or a political system decreases, its members can withdraw (”exit”), improve the situation through direct action (”voice”), or passively accept the decline in conditions (”loyalty”).
“Exit” and “loyalty” dominate in Italy.
The former can be physical (according to some studies, Italy is the only European country experiencing a “brain drain” rather than a “brain exchange”) or silent (for example, low voter turnout).
But the difficulty of critical thought in an environment of low press freedom, together with intra-family wealth transfers to young people, keep the majority loyal to the system.
“Voice” is almost absent in Italy, as dissatisfaction, however widespread, remains far from sufficient to give rise to an organized protest movement.
Instead, “Exit” and “loyalty” delay the collective consciousness-raising that Italy needs in order to ensure a gradual escape from the old-age trap.
Once all citizens are aware of the situation, it will be too late: the system will have collapsed, and “voice” will become so strong that inter-generational conflict will be unavoidable.
Will that conflict be peaceful or violent?
In the former case, a youth party might use democratic institutions to press for sharp cuts in old people’s benefits.
In the latter case, violent protests could lead to a revolutionary wave similar to 1968.
Then, protesters wanted to free disadvantaged classes from the oppression of capitalism; nowadays, they would seek to free disadvantaged generations from the fetters of gerontocracy.
Unfortunately, demographic trends make the latter scenario more likely, since young people will be a minority, unable to win power through democratic channels.
Only by adopting serious family policies, or by enfranchising new immigrants, who are usually quite young, would a democratic economic transition be more likely.
Leaders of OECD countries should look at Italy and recognize the dangers emerging from their young people who are being left behind.
In Italy itself, it is high time that older generations start acting with wisdom.

Yukos Now, Russia's Economy Later
Just as familiarity breeds contempt, success often spawns complacency.
Sadly, that seems to be the case in Russia, where the government has chosen the first period of prolonged economic growth since communism's fall--with the budget in surplus and capital flight seemingly reversed--to re-open the oligarch wars of the 1990's.
Optimists beware: the arrest of Mikhail Khodorkovsky--and the freezing of his shares in oil giant Yukos--will have a profound long-term impact on Russia's economy and on relations between business and government.
The Yukos imbroglio will not bring Russia's economy to a screeching halt, because no single company determines the country's fate. But long-term prospects are certain to deteriorate.
The problem is one of trust between the business community and the government, which in recent years had just begun to develop.
To put it bluntly, violating that fledgling trust will break the back of Russia's economic upswing.
"Operation Clean Hands"--what some are calling the investigations into Khodorkovsky and his associates--will not increase tax revenue, but only spur growth in the informal economy, as businessmen try to conceal their affairs even more completely from the government.
After all, once Russia's richest man can be stripped of his assets at any moment, ordinary Russian businessmen may be forgiven for concluding that operating in the open is risky.
The first signs of this realization will probably take the form of an increase in capital flight.
Until the Yukos affair, capital flight was reversing.
After a decade of hemorrhaging capital, the first half of this year saw data indicating that Russians who had taken their money out of the country were bringing it back to invest at home.
If capital flight resumes, it will quickly snowball if President Putin fails to convince people that the Yukos affair is an isolated case.
I believe that capital flight will increase substantially.
Reduced business activity, with long-term investment projects being cancelled, seems just as certain.
A lower rate of economic growth thus seems inevitable.
Nor am I alone.
Independent Russian economic experts are unanimous in sharing this grim conclusion.
Only people linked to the regime appear to differ.
If investment stalls, President Putin will have no hope of doubling the size of the economy within a decade, as he has promised.
My longstanding skepticism about this promise has now hardened into certainty: the Yukos affair will make it impossible to sustain the growth rate required to achieve this goal because the arrest of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and the seizure of his assets has dealt a devastating blow to business confidence.
Indeed, times have changed dramatically since the cutthroat Russian capitalism of the 1990's--supposedly a world in which entrepreneurs were indifferent, at best, to each other's problems.
That caricature, if ever true, is certainly not true today: the business community's negative reaction to the persecution of Khodorkovsky by the law enforcement agencies has been strong and nearly unanimous.
The growing calls of some state officials to deal with economic crime are viewed by the business community as both a mockery of the legal code and a veiled threat that the prosecutors want their cut of Russia's riches.
The improved image of Russia's legal system is in tatters.
Today, the business community understands that the Prosecutor General's Office can find any pretext to go after any one of them.
If prosecutors can treat huge businesses so roughly, what hope is there for medium and small businesses?
No surprise, then, that owners of companies of all sizes are now forming a united front to protect their interests.
President Putin, meanwhile, steadfastly refuses to discuss the Yukos affair or the actions of the law enforcement agencies with Russia's business community.
His silence clearly implies consent to the actions of the prosecutors.
But if the president will not publicly account for the fidelity of Russia's law enforcement agencies to law, who will?
One of the great flaws of Putin's presidency has been to allow law enforcement agencies to evaluate their own actions.
Of course, they invariably conclude that their actions were right and lawful.
So the president's position is clear and he will not back down.
In fact, only businesspeople may now be able to influence events: a sharp and pronounced slowdown, with Russian capital showing its displeasure by voting with its feet, might be the last hope for turning the prosecutors from their chosen course.
But I see no reason for optimism.
On the contrary, the arrest of Khodorkovsky has only whetted the prosecutors' appetite.
Once they have digested Yukos, they will look for another meal.
After that, can anyone seriously doubt that the craving for fresh prey will intensify?

A Prisoner’s Reflections on Nelson Mandela
KHARKIV – Incarceration is said to leave you with a feeling of helplessness and vulnerability. But the truth of life for a political prisoner, even for one on a hunger strike, is the opposite.
As a prisoner, I have been forced to focus on what is essential about myself, my political beliefs, and my country.
So I can almost feel the presence of the brave women and men, old and young, who have gathered in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities to defend their dreams of a democratic and European future.
In prison, your hopes and dreams become your reality.
I am sure that Nelson Mandela would have understood my feelings and agreed.
The South African apartheid regime may have locked him away for almost three decades, but in the great Soweto protests and the other demonstrations for freedom and equality, courageous young South Africans invariably looked to his example and felt his presence.
Around the world, most people now rightly celebrate the gentle dignity with which Mandela led South Africa out of the political wilderness.
Even here, behind prison bars and 24-hour surveillance of the type that he experienced for so long, I can conjure the warmth of his broad smile, merry eyes, and those colorful Hawaiian-style shirts that he wore with such panache.
And I can admire his unyielding – and, yes, sometimes wily – commitment to reconciliation, which saved his country from the race war that those who refused to accept the end of white-minority rule saw as inevitable.
How wrong they were, and how miraculous was Mandela’s achievement in making even his most implacable enemies feel at home in post-apartheid South Africa.
But here, in this place, it is not Mandela the statesman who touches my soul and fires my imagination.
“My” Mandela is the prisoner, the Mandela of Robben Island, who endured 27 years behind bars (18 of them on a rock in the South Atlantic) and yet emerged with his spirit intact, brimming with a vision of a tolerant South Africa, a country liberated even for apartheid’s architects and beneficiaries.
No purges marked the end of white rule.
There were no witch-hunts, nor was there summary justice.
All that Mandela demanded was that the truth about the past be revealed.
Through the unique innovation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Mandela found the only viable bridge between his country’s racist legacy and its multi-racial present and future – a combination of political genius and humane wisdom that only the greatest of leaders possess.
Mandela was able to guide South Africa to freedom, because he was able to see its future more clearly than those who lived through the apartheid years outside of prison.
Indeed, he possessed that rare clarity of moral vision that prison – perhaps like no other environment – can nurture.
Imprisonment brought Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn this clarity as well.
“Gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties, either – but right through every human heart – and through all human hearts,” he wrote in The Gulag Archipelago.
“This line shifts….And even within hearts overwhelmed by evil, one small bridgehead of good is retained. And even in the best of all hearts, there remains...an un-uprooted small corner of evil.”
The ability to begin to see more clearly than most the inner workings of the human soul is one of the few gifts that imprisonment can bestow.
Forced to reckon with your own vulnerability, isolation, and losses (and seemingly lost cause), you learn to look more carefully into the human heart – yours and that of your jailers.
Mandela epitomized this rare gift.
How else could he have personally invited one of his Robben Island jailers to attend his inauguration as South Africa’s first democratically elected president?
Of course, behind Mandela’s generous spirit was a character of steel. He bore his imprisonment for the sake of his cause.
And he bore the anguish of the suffering imposed on his family. And yet he neither broke nor surrendered to the rage that would have consumed most people.
As usual, Mandela’s own words about his day of personal liberation show how well he understood this: “As I walked out the door toward the gate that would lead to my freedom, I knew if I didn’t leave my bitterness and hatred behind, I’d still be in prison.”
And just as Mandela knew in his prison cell that apartheid would one day fall, I know in my solitude that Ukraine’s ultimate triumph as a European democracy is certain.

Sweet Caroline in Tokyo
TOKYO – Fifty years have passed since the assassination of US President John F. Kennedy, with official ceremonies held in Washington, DC, and Dallas to commemorate the anniversary.
But JFK’s eldest daughter, Caroline Kennedy, was not present at either event; she had just taken up her post in Tokyo as the 29th US Ambassador to Japan.
On November 19, thousands of people lined the streets to catch a glimpse of Kennedy as she made her way from Tokyo Station to the Imperial Palace, around a kilometer away, by horse-drawn carriage to present her credentials to the emperor.
Waving to the onlookers, she looked like Snow White.
November 22, 1963, was also the day satellite broadcasting from the United States to Japan began, and many Japanese got up early to watch a speech by JFK in Dallas that began at 5:30 a.m. But, rather than airing the speech, the broadcast brought the shocking news of the assassination.
The image of young Caroline – the inspiration for Neil Diamond’s famous song – solemnly standing beside her three-year-old brother as he saluted his father’s coffin is deeply engrained in the hearts of Japan’s people.
So there probably is not a single Japanese who would not welcome her as US Ambassador.
US ambassadors to Japan have come in three types.
There have been academic experts on Japan, like the acclaimed scholar Edwin Reischauer.
There have also been political heavyweights, such as Michael Mansfield, a long-time Democratic majority leader of the US Senate, former Vice President Walter Mondale, former Speaker of the House of Representatives Thomas Foley, and Senator Howard Baker, who also served as President Ronald Reagan’s chief of staff.
The third type are presidential political appointees, such as Thomas Schieffer, a former business partner of President George W. Bush, and John Roos, a noted Silicon Valley lawyer.
Clearly, Caroline Kennedy, an important early supporter of President Barack Obama, is in this category.
Indeed, her backing for Obama in the Democratic Party primaries in 2008, when he was still a relatively unknown senator from Illinois, gave his campaign credibility among party insiders who remain loyal to her family’s legacy.
Kennedy’s address to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee during her confirmation hearing elicited bipartisan support – a rare occurrence nowadays, given America’s highly polarized national politics – and she received unanimous approval.
Although she lacks formal political or diplomatic experience, her personal connections, particularly to Obama, will have great significance for US-Japan relations.
And there are pressing issues that need the new ambassador’s attention.
For example, there are security questions related to strengthening the alliance between Japan and the US, including the relocation of the Futenma Air Station, the base of operations for the US Marine Corps on Okinawa.
There are also issues related to economic cooperation, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the proposed mega-regional free-trade treaty covering Pacific Rim economies.
Although powerful domestic interest groups, particularly those representing the agricultural sector, have objected to Japanese participation in the TPP negotiations, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government chose to join the talks late in the day.
Instead of banking the political capital that his high approval ratings had given him, he chose to spend some of it on an initiative that his predecessors had rejected, but that will help to transform myriad aspects of Japan’s economy.
Of course, given today’s hyper-partisan environment in the US, there is a danger that fast-track negotiating authority – under which Congress binds itself to an up-or-down vote on trade agreements (thereby precluding amendments and filibusters) – will not be given to the president.
If this roadblock cannot be overcome and the agreement stalls, the Abe government’s approval ratings will suffer, despite progress in the negotiations.
Given the unanimity with which Kennedy was confirmed, she may be able to use her own political capital to help sell fast-track authority in Congress.
The Abe government is banking on its high approval rating not only to participate in the TPP, but also to address the need to escape from 15 years of deflation and strengthen Japan’s national-security posture, which has been hamstrung for decades.
Given the nexus of issues that tie vital US interests to Japan’s reform process, Kennedy, with her character and skills, could well prove to be an essential link between the countries at a crucial point in their relationship.

Who Lost Thailand?
TOKYO – Thailand, Southeast Asia’s most developed and sophisticated economy, is teetering on the edge of the political abyss.
Yet most of the rest of Asia appears to be averting its eyes from the country’s ongoing and increasingly anarchic unrest.
That indifference is not only foolish; it is dangerous.
Asia’s democracies now risk confronting the same harsh question that the United States faced when Mao Zedong marched into Beijing, and again when Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ousted the Shah in Iran.
Who, they will have to ask, lost Thailand?
Much of the world is wondering how such a successful economy could allow its politics to spin out of control.
What accounts for the armies of protesters – distinguished, gang-like, by the color of their shirts – whose mutual antipathy often borders on nihilistic rage?
The roots of the current unrest extend back more than a decade, to former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra’s first electoral victory in 2001.
Thaksin’s triumph did not represent the normal alternation in power that one finds in a democracy. Instead, his victory heralded the political rise of the country’s poor, long-silenced rural majority.
Bangkok’s entrenched elite recoiled in alarm.
But, instead of learning to compete with Thaksin for the votes of Thailand’s rural poor, the country’s urban elite (including the powerful military) sought to delegitimize his rule.
When he was re-elected by an even larger majority, his government was overthrown, his political party was banned by the Supreme Court, and he was forced to flee the country after corruption charges against him led to a criminal conviction.
Yet Thaksin’s supporters did not abandon him.
When Thailand’s military returned to their barracks, many Thai citizens voted for Thaksin at one remove, with his sister – Yingluck Shinawatra, a long-time executive at Thaksin’s communications firm – becoming Prime Minister, supported by a powerful parliamentary majority.
For much of her term in office, Yingluck garnered praise for her pragmatism, and for seeking to ameliorate the antagonism of her opponents. But that praise and success appears to have bred a form of hubris.
She proposed an amnesty law that would have not only pardoned opposition leaders, including Abhisit Vejjajiva, her predecessor as prime minister (who faces murder charges), but allowed her brother to return to the country. And, in defiance of a Supreme Court ruling, she sought a constitutional amendment that would make the Senate, whose members are appointed, an elected body.
The opposition, sensing that its moment had arrived, launched a wave of street protests.
Yingluck, in an effort to defuse the situation, called for a parliamentary election in February. But the opposition has rejected this and says that it will boycott the vote.
It fears – rightly, most people suspect – that the Thaksin camp will be returned to power in any free and fair vote.
So, in essence, what is happening in Thailand is an attempted nullification of democracy by the opposition and the country’s entrenched elite.
Unable to compete successfully with Thaksin for votes, they now want to dilute Thai democracy in order to prevent the electorate from ever again choosing a government that goes against their will.
If Thailand were an insignificant country with little geostrategic weight, its problems might not matter as much as they do to the rest of Asia. But Thailand is Southeast Asia’s lynchpin economy.
It is a key partner for Myanmar (Burma) as it makes its own political and economic transition, and it is a hub for trade with neighboring Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam.
But the biggest reason that Thailand matters for Asia’s democracies is fierce competition for influence between a rising China and the democratic world.
Until now, Thailand has been a firm member of the democratic camp.
Its military is mostly trained by the United States; indeed, it was the key staging point for the US during the Vietnam War.
Likewise, Japan and India have long regarded Thailand as a democratic bulwark in a neighborhood where some regimes – Cambodia and Laos – are firmly under China’s hegemonic sway.
Indeed, its government has proved to be a strong supporter of Myanmar’s president, Thein Sein, as he seeks to free his country from China’s tight embrace.
By standing aside as Thailand’s opposition and traditional elite seek to undermine the country’s democracy in the name of a permanent right to rule, Asia’s democracies risk driving some elements of the Thaksin camp into the arms of China, which would happily accept the role of patron to so potent a political force.
But this need not happen.
Thailand’s military has long and respectful ties not only with the US military, but with officers in Japan as well.
Thailand’s opposition politicians, many of whom were educated at top Western universities, may also be open to quiet advice that they are pushing things too far, not only putting Thailand’s stability at risk, but also jeopardizing regional security.
Just as, a decade ago, the West objected to the efforts of Turkey’s entrenched secular elite to rob Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s mildly Islamist AKP party of its democratic victory, it needs to speak clearly today in defense of Thai democracy.
The opposition’s claim that it is acting in the interests of the world’s democracies needs to be rebutted.
Thaksin may be no saint, and some constitutional reform will be needed if political reconciliation is to come about. But Thaksin’s governments, like that of his sister, have kept China at one remove from influence.
That is the key strategic interest that is now at stake.
Should Yingluck be ousted in a coup, or should the country’s democracy be hollowed out to preclude her return to power, the Shinawatras may be left with no choice but to seek support from Thailand’s giant neighbor to the north.
If that happens, we will all know who lost Thailand.
We did.

Equality or Estrangement
TOKYO – Those whom the gods would destroy, they grant their wishes.
Will that bit of ancient wisdom now hold for the United States and Japan?
For a half-century, the US, which wrote Japan’s postwar “peace” constitution, has pressed the Japanese to play a greater role in maintaining Asian and global stability.
But now that Japan finally has a leader who agrees, the US is getting nervous, with Secretary of State John Kerry supposedly calling Japan under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe “unpredictable.”
These strains in the US-Japan relationship – surely the foundation stone of Asian stability – first became noticeable in December, when Abe visited the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, which houses the “souls” of (among others) Class A war criminals from the Pacific War.
The US has always criticized Japanese officials’ visits to the shrine, but through diplomatic channels.
This time, America voiced its displeasure openly.
The US is rightly concerned about the negative impact of such pilgrimages on Japan’s relations with its neighbors, particularly China and South Korea.
But the harsh tone publicly adopted by President Barack Obama’s administration raised serious concerns among some in Abe’s government who question Obama’s commitment to the alliance and suspect that he was using the Yasukuni issue as a pretext to signal a weakening of America’s defense commitment.
Such suspicions were sharpened after China declared its new Air Defense Identification Zone, which overlaps Japanese sovereign territory.
The US tried to have it both ways: though the Obama administration sent US bombers through the new ADIZ to demonstrate its refusal to recognize China’s move, it also told US commercial airliners to acknowledge the zone and report their flight plans to the Chinese authorities.
Likewise, US acquiescence in China’s de facto ouster of the Philippines from the Scarborough Shoal (a disputed outcropping in the South China Sea) raised questions in Japan about the two countries’ supposed harmony of interests.
In fact, although the US extols the virtues of its partnership with Japan, successive American presidents have been vague about the details.
Ultimately, the idea always seemed to be that Japan would pay more for defense, but the US would set the partnership’s objectives.
Abe’s conception of the US-Japan partnership presupposes much greater equality.
After all, a society like Japan, trying to escape two decades of economic malaise, cannot feel completely comfortable outsourcing its national-security strategy, even to an ally that is as respected and reliable as the US.
Far from being based on chest-thumping nationalism, Abe’s national-security strategy reflects, above all, a deep awareness of how a lost generation of economic growth has affected the Japanese.
His bravura diplomatic performances sometimes give the impression that a self-confident Japan has been a normal feature of the global landscape. Strangely, it is all but forgotten – particularly by the Chinese – that for two decades Japan has watched China’s rise quietly from the sidelines (even supportively, to the extent that Japanese investors have poured in billions of dollars in the three decades since Deng Xiaoping opened the economy).
Indeed, Abe has succeeded so well in returning Japan to the world stage that his US and Asian critics act as if the only problem now is to moderate Japanese self-confidence – a notion that would have been laughable just two years ago.
But the fact remains that one of Abe’s primary worries is the spiritual malaise that accompanied Japan’s long economic stagnation.
Those who see in his patriotic rhetoric a desire to whitewash history miss his real concern: economic revival is meaningless if it does not secure Japan’s position as a leading Asian power.
The US, however, regards Abe’s worries about Japan’s spirit as peripheral to its efforts to forge a lasting relationship with China and overhaul its strategic presence in the Pacific.
For example, the US views the Trans-Pacific Partnership – the huge trade agreement involving it, Japan, and 10 other leading Pacific Rim countries – as a technical scheme that will bring economic benefits through greater trade.
But, for Abe, the TPP’s value for Japan’s sense of identity – that it is now a more outward-looking nation – is just as important.
In Abe’s view, Japan needs to regain, wherever possible, the right of independent decision-making if it is to manage successfully the challenge posed to it by China.
This does not mean that Abe’s Japan will become an ally like France under Jacques Chirac, spurning US leadership for the sake of it; instead, Abe seeks a policy of cooperation with the US that reflects the alliance's voluntary nature.
He believes that, given the new balance of power in Asia, the alliance will be meaningful only if each partner has a real choice, and the wherewithal, to act autonomously or with regional allies.
Fortunately, Japanese and American analyses of Chinese trends are not very different.
Both generally view China as having embarked on a probing strategy in search of weak spots where it can expand its geopolitical reach.
And both believe that only when China is convinced that such probes will yield no lasting benefit can serious negotiations about a comprehensive security structure for Asia take place.
But even here, there is a difference.
The US, convinced of the importance of intentions in the conduct of foreign policy, believes that once China recognizes the limits to its power, a structure of peace will follow naturally.
Abe, by contrast, believes that only a favorable balance of power can be relied upon, and he is determined that Japan play its part in constructing that balance.
Although Abe has lifted Japan’s sights and self-confidence, he recognizes that Japan faces real limits.
The US, too, should recognize that there are limits to the extent of the subordination that it can ask of an ally.
Some wishes really are better left unfulfilled.

Securing Japan
TOKYO – Shinzo Abe’s second term as Japan’s prime minister began with a laser-like focus on economic revitalization.
That policy, almost instantly dubbed “Abenomics,” comprises what have been called the three “arrows”: bold monetary policy, an expansionary fiscal stance, and structural reforms to stimulate private investment.
Hosting the Olympic Games in Tokyo in 2020 has added a fourth arrow to this quiver in the form of increased infrastructure investment and tourism revenue in the years leading up to the Games.
To be sure, after 15 years of deflationary recession, revitalization of the Japanese economy remains far from complete.
Nonetheless, the effects of Abe’s reforms are becoming visible in areas such as equity prices and exchange rates.
But Abe also confronts a security environment in Asia that is every bit as brittle as Japan’s economy was before his government took office last December.
Indeed, he confronted many of the same issues during his first administration seven years ago.
His efforts back then were halted by his own resignation, and he is now making a second attempt to establish a national-security governance system to meet Japan’s needs – and those of its allies – in twenty-first-century Asia.
In a speech to a plenary session of the lower house of Japan’s Diet on October 25, Abe emphasized that, given the current security situation in Asia, “It is essential to strengthen command functions for implementing the prime minister’s national security policy.”
Now that split control of the Diet’s upper and lower houses has been resolved, with Abe’s Liberal Democrats in strong control of both chambers, a bill to modernize Japan’s national-security governance is certain to pass.
The bill that Abe has submitted aims to establish a Japanese National Security Council, based on lessons from the successes and failures of similar institutions in other countries, such as the NSC in the United States.
The Security Council of Japan – something of a stopgap measure created to provide advice from relevant cabinet members to the prime minister in times of crisis – will now be reorganized as a formal institution.
The new NSC’s membership will be limited to the prime minister, the cabinet secretary, and the foreign and defense ministers, with relevant ministers added on an ad hoc basis.
A permanent National Security Secretariat, headed by a person with abundant diplomatic experience, will be established in the prime minister’s office, with 60 security specialists from various fields laying the policy groundwork for medium- and long-term national security strategy. This strategy will then be reflected in guidelines issued to Japan’s defense bodies and diplomats.
Japan, like other countries, has faced jurisdictional disputes among foreign-policy, defense, and police agencies that have hindered the aggregation and analysis of intelligence information.
But, with the creation of the NSC, each ministry and agency will report important national-security information to the new secretariat, which will then carry out integrated analysis and issue reports to the prime minister and others.
Of course, as in other countries, bureaucracies are creatures of habit.
As we can already see, it will not be easy to overcome the obstacles posed by vertically integrated ministries and agencies.
Institutionalization will take time – and the importance of its success cannot be understated.
For example, the new NSC will be responsible for sharing intelligence with other countries, including the US, Japan’s most important ally.
As a result, ensuring the protection of information will be a key issue, particularly given the old habit of leaking security information to the press.
That is why the Diet is also considering a bill on the protection of classified information that would impose harsher punishment on government officials who leak secrets, particularly those concerning national security.
The trauma of gag laws that were imposed on the press before and during World War II resulted in the elimination of all restraints afterwards, which had the effect of making Japan a spy’s paradise, with insufficient counterintelligence measures and poor secrecy.
Moreover, the long decades of peace since 1945 have served to lower awareness among politicians of the need for confidentiality.
For example, Japanese newspapers always report when, where, and with whom the Prime Minister met for dinner in the following day’s editions.
In contrast to the US system of presidential government, Japan has a parliamentary form of government.
Yet the goals of national security and crisis management are the same in both systems – indeed, one of British Prime Minister David Cameron’s first acts when he came to power was to establish an NSC to improve coordination of policymaking.
Although the establishment of the Japanese NSC is long overdue, it is not too late for Japan to benefit from the improvement in policy direction and coherence that it seems certain to bring.

The Pyongyang Purge
TOKYO – During the Cold War, the term “Kremlinology” referred to efforts to understand what was taking place at the commanding heights of the Soviet Union – indeed, behind the entire Iron Curtain.
Kremlinologists monitored (in whatever way possible) who was up and who was down among the core Soviet leadership.
Great significance was read into who signed an official document, or who stood where atop Lenin’s Tomb in Red Square when reviewing military parades.
All of that was grammar-school stuff compared to efforts to decipher the regime in North Korea, where the truth is far more opaque.
Consider what happened on December 17.
Choe Ryong-hae, Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission of the Korean Workers’ Party, was conspicuously present on stage at the commemoration of the second anniversary of “Dear Leader” Kim Jong-il’s death – the first major ceremony following the purge and execution of Jang Song-thaek, the former vice chairman of the National Defense Commission.
Choe’s speech, with its threats against the United States and South Korea, seemed to set the stage for his political elevation.
Jang Song-thaek had been seen as a kind of regent to Kim Jong-un, the young successor to the Kim family dynasty, and was thought to be number two in the regime.
But he owed his position to his wife, Kim Kyong-hui, the only sister of Kim Jong-il, Kim Jong-un’s deceased father.
Jang’s tact, as well as his usefulness as an interlocutor with China, enabled him to keep his position, despite his long-term separation from his wife.
But in North Korea, blood is paramount: everything, including ideology and the national interest, is subservient to the maintenance of the Kim dynasty.
The “legacy” of the “Great Leader” Kim Il-sung and his son, “Dear Leader” Kim Jong-il, determines all major decisions.
I have long believed that the true holder of power since Kim Jong-il’s death has been his sister, Kim Kyong-hui, and no one else.
North Korean culture would suggest that women do not take positions of leadership, but it appears that she was the only family member whom Kim Jong-il could trust.
When he was incapacitated by illness, it was she who called the shots.
Her blood tie to the Kim dynasty is the reason why, even after her husband was purged and executed (and the rest of his family rounded up), she maintained her political position.
It has even been suggested that she made the decision to purge her husband.
Though it cannot be known whether she also proposed killing him, it is not surprising that she believed that, with her own health failing, she could not leave the family dynasty to her husband’s care.
Perhaps the most chilling aspect of Jang’s execution is that it appears to be part of a feeding frenzy that has claimed the lives of a number of senior officials and generals.
And the bloodletting has been extremely personal: In August, Kim Jong-un reportedly ordered the execution by firing squad of an ex-girlfriend and other members of her musical ensemble; the killings are said to have been carried out in front of their families.
Elsewhere in the communist world, such murderous purges were renounced long ago, first in the Soviet Union by Khrushchev, following his denunciation of Stalin, and then in China by Deng Xiaoping, following his rehabilitation and return to power in the late 1970’s.
This “reform” did not make these regimes any more beneficent or efficient, but it did bring a degree of stability and predictability to their behavior.
North Korea, always the least predictable of totalitarian communist states, remains in a twilight world.
More disturbing is the question of whether China is going down a parallel path under President Xi Jinping.
Ever since Deng’s rule, there has been an understanding that members of the Chinese Communist Party’s Politburo are not to be touched, even in retirement.
But Xi, under the pretext of his anti-corruption battle, has targeted retired Politburo member Zhou Yongkang, who is now reportedly under house arrest, facing graft charges – and lurid allegations not only that he murdered his first wife but that he tried to assassinate Xi.
China’s emphasis since Deng on rule by consensus may not have made the country any more democratic, but it at least prevented the re-emergence of a new cult of personality à la Mao Zedong.
The question today is whether Xi’s flouting of this internal party convention is another step in re-creating one-man – and thus completely arbitrary – rule in China.
In North Korea, of course, arbitrary rule – no matter how bizarre and inept – is always the norm.
And now, with Jang purged, responsibility for economic failure in North Korea has been shifted to Choe.
All officials and people related to him now live under the shadow of the executioner, for he is certain to bear the blame when the dynasty needs a scapegoat for its mounting problems.
And Jang’s purge may make those problems worse.
While China lost a convenient point of contact with the Kim regime, North Korea may have lost the only channel by which to sustain itself.
The economy cannot be revived so long as international sanctions are maintained, and the sanctions seem certain to remain in place so long as the regime continues with its nuclear brinkmanship.
China, which has been the Kim dynasty’s lifeline, no longer appears willing to offer it a blank check.
So the day is fast approaching when Kim Jong-un and his clan will have to take responsibility for the country’s dire condition, and it may come soon after Kim Kyong-hui dies.
If so, the Kim dynasty’s last chapter may have begun with the current spasm of executions, though the ending – for the Korean Peninsula and East Asia alike – remains very much in doubt.

The New Neutrality
TOKYO – Throughout the Cold War, the Soviet Union used every imaginable threat and inducement – including the ultimate prize of reunification – to bring about a neutral Germany.
But German leaders of both the left and the right, from Konrad Adenauer to Willy Brandt, spurned every Soviet offer.
Will authoritarian mercantilism now succeed where communism failed?
Countries join alliances, or entities such as the European Union, because these groups make the benefits and obligations of membership as unambiguous as anything in international relations can be.
For Germany and South Korea, however, relationships with historic allies – NATO and the United States, respectively – appear to be changing before our eyes.
Through their huge purchases of goods, with promises of even more to come, today’s authoritarian/mercantilist regimes in Russia and China may be about to achieve by commerce what the Soviets could not achieve by bribery and threats.
And the scale of that commerce is breathtaking, with German exports to China growing from $25.9 billion a decade ago to $87.6 billion in 2011, while South Korea’s exports have increased from $53 billion to $133 billion during the same period of time.
A form of stealth neutralism, indeed, appears to be entering both countries’ diplomacy. Witness Chinese President Xi Jinping’s recent trip to South Korea, German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s unwillingness to impose effective sanctions on Russia for its intervention in Ukraine, and the business-only focus of her just-concluded visit to China.
In both Germany and South Korea, the idea that historic alliances may offer fewer tangible benefits than tacit neutrality – particularly in terms of exports – appears to be taking root, especially among business elites.
Xi’s visit to Seoul was another bold step in China’s systematic efforts to wean South Korea from its commitment to the US-led international economic order.
By offering to permit South Korea to settle its bilateral trade accounts in renminbi, and to launch the first-ever Sino-South Korean initiative toward North Korea, Xi is seeking to convince South Korea’s leaders that the country’s future, including reunification, will be determined in Beijing.
China’s invitation to South Korea to participate in a new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (alongside other countries in Asia and the Arab world, but excluding Japan and India) furthers Xi’s efforts to create an alternative financial system, with the AIIB mimicking the Asia Development Bank’s work.
China’s embrace of South Korea is part of a long-term strategy to turn it into a subordinate state in terms of foreign and national security policy (much as Finland kowtowed to the Soviet Union throughout the Cold War).
And yet, though courted by all sides in the struggle to maintain stability in Northeast Asia, South Korea now runs the risk of becoming isolated.
Every gesture by the South toward one of the protagonists – China, the US, Japan, and North Korea – elicits so much pressure by the others that its government must then somehow devise a compensatory policy.
For example, following President Park Geun-hye’s request that Xi honor the Korean assassin of a Japanese prime minister, to which Xi readily agreed, she began to discuss joining the US-led Trans-Pacific Partnership free-trade negotiations, in order to assuage the US.
As China continued to pursue an anti-Japanese propaganda campaign throughout 2013, Park felt obliged to make some effort to revive ties with Japan by sending a private envoy to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to seek talks on reconciling their disputes.
Given its insecurity, a by-product of the Korean Peninsula’s long division, South Korea requires, above all, calm and steady partners.
But frequent changes in US policy toward Northeast Asia in recent years have disoriented South Korean policymakers, while Chinese policy, though consistent, confronts South Korea’s leaders with choices that they appear unprepared to make.
As a result, South Korea’s elite appears to be splitting into pro-Chinese and pro-American factions that transcend party lines.
Over a period of time, the only beneficiaries are likely to be those who call for “Finlandization” of the Korean peninsula.
Meanwhile, the impact on German foreign policy of the country’s deepening economic ties with Russia has been evident throughout the Ukraine crisis.
Though Merkel frequently admonished the Kremlin about its intervention in Ukraine, German public opinion – particularly that of the country’s business leaders – tied her hands.
Indeed, German big businesses have been the main obstacle to imposing the type of systemic sanctions that might have dissuaded Russian President Vladimir Putin from annexing Crimea and continuing to back the insurgency (which Russia itself incited) in eastern Ukraine.
This is not the only recent case in which Germany has distanced itself from its allies and partners.
In Libya in 2011, Germany refused to offer even rudimentary material support to the military intervention staged by its British and French allies.
Germany has also continuously failed to meet its commitment to spend 2% of its GDP on defense, at the same time that it has insisted that troubled EU economies stick to austerity budgets that limit their deficits to a fixed proportion of their economic output.
Indeed, throughout the eurozone crisis, Germany did the absolute minimum – and always at the last possible moment – to assist its EU partners.
And German leaders’ obsession with maintaining their country’s “golden decade” of exports appears to have gagged them on topics like China’s human rights abuses and its aggressive behavior toward its Asian neighbors.
That silence is being rewarded with the first-ever joint cabinet sessions between a democracy and a communist dictatorship, which will take place in Berlin this autumn.
In both Germany and South Korea, economic strength seems to have produced an illusion of policy independence that is opening a chasm between the two countries and their allies – a chasm that revelations of US spying, on Merkel in particular, have deepened.
Germany and South Korea, however, will gain little, and risk much, if they downgrade their alliance ties in favor of commercially motivated, if unofficial, neutrality.
Whatever short-term benefits they receive will be more than offset by their strategic vulnerabilities vis-à-vis Russia and China.

Taming the China Bears
BEIJING – The market is always in search of a story, and investors, it seems, think they have found a new one this year in China.
The country’s growth slowdown and mounting financial risks have spurred a growing wave of pessimism, with economists worldwide warning of an impending crash.
But dire predictions for China have abounded for the last 30 years, and not one has materialized.
Are today’s really so different?
The short answer is no.
Like the predictions of the past, today’s warnings are based on historical precedents and universal indicators against which China, with its unique economic features, simply cannot be judged accurately.
The bottom line is that the complexity and distinctiveness of China’s economy mean that assessing its current state and performance requires a detail-oriented analysis that accounts for as many offsetting factors as possible.
Predictions are largely pointless, given that the assumptions underpinning them will invariably change.
Consider China’s high leverage ratio, which many argue will be a key factor in causing a crisis.
After all, they contend, developing countries that have experienced a large-scale credit boom have all ended up facing a credit crisis and a hard economic landing.
But several specific factors must be accounted for in assessing whether this is China’s fate.
While China’s debt/GDP ratio is very high, the same is true in many successful East Asian economies, such as Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, and Malaysia.
And China’s saving rate is much higher.
Ceteris paribus, the higher the saving rate, the less likely it is that a high debt/GDP ratio will trigger a financial crisis.
In fact, China’s high debt/GDP ratio is, to a large extent, a result of its simultaneously high saving and investment rates.
And, while the inability to repay loans can contribute to a high debt burden, the nonperforming-loan (NPL) ratio for China’s major banks stands at less than 1%.
If, based on these considerations, one concludes that China’s debt/GDP ratio does constitute a substantial threat to its financial stability, there remains the question of whether a crisis is likely to occur.
Only when all of the specific linkages between a high debt burden and the onset of a financial crisis have been identified can one draw even a tentative conclusion about that.
China’s real-estate price bubble is often named as a likely catalyst for a crisis.
But how such a downturn would unfold is far from certain.
Let us assume that the real-estate bubble has burst.
In China, there are no subprime mortgages, and the down payment on the purchase price required to qualify for financing can exceed 50%.
Given that property prices are unlikely to fall by such a large margin, the bubble’s collapse would not bring down China’s banks.
Even if real-estate prices fell by more than 50%, commercial banks could survive – not least because mortgages account for only about 20% of banks’ total assets.
At the same time, plummeting prices would attract new homebuyers in major cities, causing the market to stabilize.
And China’s recently announced urbanization strategy should ensure that cities’ demographic structure supports intrinsic demand.
If that were not enough to ward off disaster, the government could purchase unsold properties and use them for social housing.
Moreover, if necessary, banks could recover funds by selling collateral.
As a last resort, the government could step in, as it did in the late 1990’s and early 2000’s, to remove NPLs from banks’ balance sheets.
Indeed, China has a massive war chest of foreign-exchange reserves that it would not hesitate to use to inject capital into commercial banks.
That remains a highly unlikely scenario.
China’s banking system does face risks stemming from a maturity mismatch between loans and deposits.
But the mismatch is less severe than some observers believe.
In fact, the average term of deposits in China’s banks is about nine months, while medium- and long-term loans account for just over half of total outstanding credit.
A more salient threat would arise if the government pursued too much capital-account liberalization too fast.
If China eases restrictions on cross-border capital flows, an unexpected shock could trigger large-scale capital flight, bringing down the entire financial system.
Given this, it is vital that China maintains controls over short-term cross-border capital flows in the foreseeable future.
Likewise, the Chinese government must address a fundamental contradiction.
Monetary interest rates have increased steadily, owing to rampant regulatory arbitrage (whereby banks find loopholes that enable them to avoid unfavorable rules) and the fragmentation of the credit market, while return on capital has fallen rapidly because of overcapacity.
If the Chinese government fails to reverse this trend, a financial crisis – in one form or another – will become inevitable.
But, given the authorities’ broad scope for policy intervention, the crash will not come anytime soon – if it comes at all.

The Long March from the Third Plenum
BEIJING – Though China’s leadership succession was completed earlier this year, the policy agenda for the coming decade has only just been revealed.
Following Chinese political tradition, the country’s new leadership had to wait for the Third Plenum of the Chinese Communist Party’s 18th Central Committee – held 3-4 quarters after the First Plenum, where the succession was sealed – to unveil its economic-policy priorities.
Third Plenums – and perhaps only Third Plenums – can bring about radical transformation.
Indeed, it was at the Third Plenum of the CCP’s 11th Central Committee that Deng Xiaoping launched the reforms that opened up the Chinese economy and triggered more than three decades of rapid economic growth.
The Third Plenums of the CCP’s 14th and 16th Central Committees – held in 1993 and 2003, respectively – also stand out.
At both meetings, CCP leaders put forward comprehensive plans for the creation and perfection of the so-called “socialist market economy” in China.
The 60-point “resolution” produced at the most recent Third Plenum covers six areas: the economy, the political system, the environment, culture, society, and Party capacity-building.
This represents a significant departure from the agendas produced at previous Third Plenums, which focused exclusively on economic reform.
But, when it comes to economic-reform objectives, the resolution is not overwhelmingly innovative.
Indeed, most of the goals that it includes – like reform of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), development of private enterprise, reduction of government intervention, protection of property rights, and creation of a modern market system – can be found in the resolution of the Third Plenum of the CCP’s 16th Central Committee.
Even the decision to redefine the market’s role in resource allocation as “decisive” was not the breakthrough that many observers have claimed.
After all, the 2003 resolution had already defined the market as “fundamental” to resource allocation.
Given this, the latest resolution’s most important implication is that it has dispelled any doubt about the new leadership’s commitment to the market-oriented reform that Deng initiated in 1978.
In line with tradition, the Third Plenum’s resolution did not discuss problems concerning growth and development, which one hopes the government will address in greater detail in the near future.
That said, some of the resolution’s specific provisions for economic reform represent much-needed progress.
· SOEs will be required to deliver 30% of their profits to the state, instead of keeping most – or even all – of their profits, as they have done for the last two decades.
· Farmers will be granted more property rights, allowing them, for example, to transfer and mortgage land-use rights, though the government understandably continues to exercise caution about rural-land privatization.
· A real-estate property tax will be introduced, in order to suppress skyrocketing housing prices and reduce the vacancy rate – a controversial but perhaps necessary move.
· The one-child policy will be eased, allowing a couple to have two children if one parent is an only child.
(Whether this change will be enough to reverse problematic demographic trends remains a topic of heated debate.)
· The government will “accelerate the reform of the household registration system,” in an effort to facilitate urbanization.
But emphasis seems to have shifted to encourage coordinated development between urban and rural areas.
While rural migrant workers will be encouraged to settle in small and medium-size cities, migration to metropolises will remain tightly controlled – or even be more strictly regulated.
But the resolution’s genuinely groundbreaking objectives lie in other areas.
For starters, the resolution includes two potentially game-changing legal reforms.
First, it emphasizes the government’s commitment to “respect and protect human rights,” prohibiting law-enforcement authorities from extracting confessions “by torture, corporal punishment, or abuse” and abolishing widely criticized programs for “re-education through the labor system.”
Second, in order to strengthen judicial independence, the resolution includes a call “to explore the establishment of judicial jurisdiction systems that are suitably separated from administrative areas.”
In other words, the courts should be able to make decisions independently of the local governments that finance them.
In the political realm, the resolution includes measures to strengthen China’s so-called “consultative democracy.”
While the concept of enhancing the role of non-CCP forces in Chinese politics is not new, its prominence in the resolution reflects the Party’s willingness to adopt a more democratic political system – as long as it retains its dominant position, of course.
In a one-party system, meritocracy is a prerequisite for good governance, which in turn plays a central role in maintaining social stability.
Unfortunately, meritocracy has been eroded by a political culture of sycophancy and cynicism.
Designing a screening mechanism to minimize adverse selection in choosing bureaucrats and party officials has become one of the biggest challenges that China’s ruling elites confront.
Although the resolution’s general message is encouraging, a shopping list of reform objectives is not a strategic analysis of the contradictions that are undermining China’s development, let alone an action plan for responding to these contradictions.
Indeed, for China’s new leadership, the successful completion of the Third Plenum is only the first step in a new long march toward a more stable, prosperous future.

China’s Trilemma
BEIJING – The Nobel laureate economist Robert Mundell showed that an economy can maintain two – but only two – of three key features: monetary-policy independence, a fixed exchange rate, and free cross-border capital flows. But China is currently juggling all three – an act that is becoming increasingly difficult to sustain.
At first glance, this may not seem to be the case.
Given that the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has largely maintained its monetary-policy independence over the last three decades, and actively manages the renminbi’s exchange rate, it is natural to conclude that China imposes strict controls on capital flows.
In fact, China liberalized inward foreign direct investment more than 20 years ago, and eased controls for much of the capital account thereafter.
China’s efforts to regulate cross-border capital flows have never been very effective.
During the Asian financial crisis of the 1990s, China had to implement draconian measures to prevent capital flight.
In the early 2000s, short-term capital began to flow into China, with investors betting on the renminbi’s appreciation and, from 2004-2006, on rising asset prices.
Since renminbi internationalization was launched in 2009, exchange-rate arbitrage and the carry trade have surged.
Certainly, China’s capital controls, though porous, increase the transaction costs of moving short-term capital to and from China, thereby reducing upward pressure on the renminbi’s exchange rate; in extreme circumstances, this could play a decisive role in China’s financial security. But capital continues to flow – if not entirely freely – across China’s borders.
This raises an obvious question: How has China managed to defy the Mundell trilemma by maintaining all three policy objectives simultaneously?
The answer lies in China’s sterilization policy.
China has run a capital-account surplus for most of the last 30 years, and a trade surplus every year since 1993.
The PBOC keeps the exchange rate stable by intervening heavily in the foreign-exchange market, creating so much liquidity that the authorities must engage in massive sterilization to avoid overshooting the targeted increase in the monetary base.
In China, unlike in advanced countries, monetary and sterilization policy are often one in the same.
The degree to which monetary policy is expansionary depends on the degree to which the liquidity created by currency-market intervention has been sterilized.
The most frequently used monetary instrument in sterilization is open-market operations.
Given China’s twin surpluses, the PBOC sold all of the government bonds that it had accumulated in 2003, so it has been selling central-bank bills ever since, with CN¥5 trillion ($812 billion) in such bills currently held by banks.
Another important instrument for sterilization is the reserve-requirement ratio, which, when raised, locks a large amount of liquidity in the banking system.
The ratio, which the PBOC has changed 42 times since 1998, currently stands at 20% – double the ratio for large banks in the United States.
Whatever the mechanism, the costs of sterilization are very high.
For starters, by maintaining an undervalued real exchange rate, China has fallen into the so-called “dollar trap,” boosting the US dollar’s international importance at China’s own expense.
As time passes, the senselessness of this policy will become increasingly apparent.
Sterilization also leads to a serious misallocation of resources, most obviously by functioning as a subsidy to the export sector, at the expense of the rest of the economy.
A less noticed form of resource misallocation stems from the fact that only sellers of foreign exchange gain liquidity, but the whole economy feels the effects.
As a result, small and medium-size enterprises that produce non-tradable products are denied much-needed funds and suffer from sterilization’s negative externalities.
Furthermore, the high reserve ratio and forced purchase of central-bank bills squeezes commercial banks’ profits severely – a phenomenon that will be intensified by interest-rate liberalization.
The quest for yield on available funds will drive banks to make riskier investments.
There are also quasi-fiscal costs involved.
Fortunately, despite the low returns on foreign assets, this is not yet a major problem for China, owing to the low costs of the corresponding PBOC liabilities.
Nonetheless, though predictions that China would abandon its exchange-rate controls in order to uphold monetary autonomy have proved wrong over the last decade, this time may be different.
With China’s liberalization of interest rates and short-term capital flows making it increasingly difficult for the country to juggle Mundell’s “irreconcilable trinity,” one hopes that Chinese leaders will finally allow the renminbi to float, while keeping in place existing capital controls.

Reviving China’s Rebalancing
BEIJING – China is at a crossroads.
After experiencing three decades of unprecedentedly rapid GDP growth, the country weathered the global economic crisis exceptionally well.
But it sustains considerable economic imbalances, which are undermining its ability to achieve high-income status.
The question is whether China’s leaders – preoccupied with challenges like financial instability stemming from risky shadow-banking activities and a heavy burden of local-government debt – have the policy space to put the economy on a sounder footing.
In the aftermath of the global economic crisis, China appeared to be on track to complete such a rebalancing.
Its current-account surplus fell from more than 10% of GDP in 2007 to 2.6% in 2012, and it ran a large capital-account deficit for the first time since 1998.
Moreover, China added only $98.7 billion to its foreign-exchange reserves in 2012, compared to an average annual increase of more than $435 billion from 2007 to 2011.
That meant diminishing upward pressure on the renminbi’s exchange rate.
But, over the last year, China’s imbalances returned with a vengeance.
Its 2013 trade surplus likely exceeded $250 billion; its capital-account surplus exceeded $200 billion in the first three quarters of the year; and its foreign-exchange reserves soared by $509.7 billion.
Meanwhile, the lower current-account surplus (as a share of GDP) could be a result of its increased investment-income deficit.
And, while recovery in the advanced economies boosted exports, persistent overcapacity, combined with slower household-consumption growth than in 2012, caused investment growth, though still rapid, to decline to its lowest rate in the past 11 years.
In principle, a country can run a current-account deficit or surplus continuously for decades.
But China’s chronic surpluses are problematic.
Given that China remains among the world’s poorest countries, with per capita income amounting to less than $7,000, its position as the world’s largest exporter of capital signifies a gross misallocation of resources.
In fact, after running twin current- and capital-account surpluses persistently for two decades, China’s foreign-exchange reserves are poised to break the $4 trillion threshold, with the marginal cost of every dollar accrued vastly surpassing its potential benefits.
In this context, the continued accumulation of foreign-exchange reserves is clearly counterproductive.
Of course, rebalancing China’s economy will take time, and it will entail some risks and sacrifices.
But China’s leaders must recognize that the country faces massive welfare losses, and thus should be willing to accept slower growth in the short term in exchange for a more stable long-term growth path.
In fact, with a well-designed policy package, the duration and impact of the growth slowdown could be minimized.
A critical first step is for the People’s Bank of China to stop intervening in the foreign-exchange market, which would halt the growth of the country’s foreign-exchange reserves.
In other words, China should adopt a floating exchange-rate regime as soon as possible.
Although this transition would have a negative impact on China’s economic growth, it would not be nearly as dire as many seem to believe.
For starters, while it would likely cause the renminbi to strengthen, the consensus in China is that the current exchange rate is not far from the equilibrium level, meaning that the appreciation would likely be moderate.
Likewise, although renminbi appreciation would diminish export growth, the slowdown would probably not be dramatic, given that China’s export sector is dominated by the processing trade (specifically, the assembly of intermediate inputs imported from countries like Japan and South Korea).
And the accompanying increase in imports is unlikely to damage China’s economic growth significantly; it is more likely to complement, rather than substitute for, domestic demand.
In short, China can afford the costs of rebalancing.
Given that the liquidity flowing into China over the last several years was increasingly short-term capital aimed at exchange-rate and interest-rate arbitrage (so-called “hot money”), there may be a surge in capital outflows when appreciation expectations have disappeared.
To prevent large-scale capital flight from threatening China’s financial stability, cross-border flows must be managed carefully.
A flexible exchange rate dictated by market forces would eliminate the opportunities for currency speculators to make one-way bets on renminbi appreciation, thereby diminishing the stock of hot money that currently accounts for the bulk of China’s capital-account surplus. Even if China’s current account remained in surplus for some time, the shift from twin surpluses to a more normal external position would boost the efficiency of resource allocation considerably.
For too long, China has delayed the necessary adjustment of its balance-of-payments structure.
It is time to make a change, even if it requires bracing for some risks.

China’s Investment Addiction
BEIJING – China’s economy slowed unexpectedly in the second quarter of this year.
Just as unexpectedly, most data released since July suggest that China’s growth has stabilized.
Markets, not surprisingly, have breathed a collective sigh of relief.
But should investors still be nervous?
Currently, the most severe problem confronting Chinese authorities is overcapacity.
For example, China’s annual production capacity for crude steel is one billion tons, but its total output in 2012 was 720 million tons – a capacity utilization rate of 72%.
More strikingly, the steel industry’s profitability was just 0.04% in 2012.
Indeed, the profit on two tons of steel was just about enough to buy a lollipop.
So far this year, the average profitability of China’s top 500 companies is 4.34%, down 33 basis points from 2012.
Some say that today’s overcapacity is a result of China’s past overinvestment.
Others attribute it to a lack of effective demand.
The government seems to come down in the middle.
On one hand, the authorities have ordered thousands of companies to reduce capacity.
On the other hand, the government has introduced some “mini-stimulus” measures, ranging from exemptions for “micro firms” from business and sales taxes to pressure on banks to increase loans to exporters.
The authorities’ official line is that China’s growth model requires less investment and more consumption.
But not all Chinese economists agree.
They argue that capital stock is the key factor for growth, and that China’s per capita capital stock is still low relative to developed countries, which implies considerable scope for further investment.
To be sure, capital accumulation is a driving force of economic growth, and catching up with developed-country income levels implies that China must increase its capital stock in the long run.
But what is at issue is not the size of the capital stock, or even the level of investment; the problem is the growth rate of investment, which has been significantly higher than that of GDP for decades.
According to official statistics, China’s investment rate is approaching 50% of GDP.
Given absorption constraints, capital efficiency has been falling steadily amid increasing deadweight.
If environmental damage caused by breakneck investment growth were taken into account, China’s capital efficiency would be even lower.
Human capital and technological progress are as important to economic growth as physical capital and labor, if not more so.
If resource allocation is skewed toward physical capital at the expense of accumulating human capital – for which adequate consumption is indispensable – economic growth would be more likely to slow than rise.
So China should reduce the growth rate of investment and increase that of consumption, allowing the investment rate to settle at a more sustainable level.
Of course, it is not entirely untrue that China’s overcapacity reflects a shortfall of effective demand.
But where can effective demand come from?
Again, China’s steel industry provides a telling example.
Despite China’s lack of a comparative advantage for steel production, it has built approximately one thousand mills, with output accounting for roughly half of the global total.
As early as 2004, China’s government tried to clamp down on overinvestment; and yet output increased dramatically, from 300 million tons that year to a billion tons in 2012, owing to strong demand generated by investment in infrastructure and real-estate development.
China’s investment consists of mainly three broad categories: manufacturing industry, infrastructure, and real estate.
In late 2008 and 2009, at the height of the global financial crisis, stimulus-fueled infrastructure investment sustained output growth.
In 2010, investment in real-estate development replaced infrastructure investment as the main driver of growth.
Today, both infrastructure and real estate are important drivers of China’s growth.
China does need more infrastructure investment – particularly in power and water utilities, transport, and communications.
But the pace of investment must take financial constraints fully into consideration.
More important, China can and should invest more in social infrastructure such as schools, hospitals, retirement homes, and so on.
However, real-estate investment is another story.
It is difficult to judge how serious China’s property bubble is and when it might burst.
But one thing is certain: China has invested too much in real-estate development.
With per capita income at less than $6,000, homeownership in China is roughly 90%, compared to less than 70% in the United States.
Average floor space per capita is 32.9 square meters, while median floor space per family in Hong Kong is just 48 square meters.
China has 696 five-star hotels, with another 500 on the way.
Five of the ten tallest skyscrapers under construction worldwide are in China.
In my view, this is madness.
China’s economy is being held hostage by real-estate investment.
On one hand, China should not try to eliminate overcapacity by maintaining the high growth rate of real-estate investment.
While investment in social housing should be welcomed, real-estate investment, currently running at 10-13% of GDP, is already far too high.
On the other hand, if real-estate investment growth falls, overcapacity will be difficult to eliminate.
This dilemma highlights the structural-adjustment challenge that China faces – and should give investors reason to hold their breath.
That said, there are two caveats.
First, unlike other categories of investment, real estate investment does not increase productive capital stock.
There is no fundamental difference between a house and an expensive durable consumer good.
Second, in China’s statistics, the growth rate of gross fixed-asset investment is much higher than that of gross capital formation.
This indicates that data on the growth rate of fixed-asset investment may have exaggerated the pace of capital-stock accumulation.
Hence, while the Chinese government should be firm on reducing the dependence of growth on investment, it must exercise utmost care when doing so.

China’s Fire Next Time
BEIJING – Earlier this year, rumors of China’s impending financial doom – triggered by either a housing-market crash or local-government debt defaults – were rampant.
But, in recent months, the economy has stabilized, leaving few doubts about China’s ability to grow by more than 7% this year.
Given that the Chinese government had ample scope for policy intervention, this turnaround should come as no surprise.
But the moment of financial reckoning has merely been postponed, not averted.
The fundamental problems that triggered alarm bells in the first place – including real-estate bubbles, local-government debt, rapid growth in shadow-banking activity, and rising corporate leverage ratios – remain unresolved.
Of these, the most immediate threat to China’s economic and financial stability is the combination of high borrowing costs, low profitability for nonfinancial corporations, and very high corporate leverage ratios.
According to a study by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the debt/GDP ratio for China’s nonfinancial corporations was 113% by the end of 2012.
Standard & Poor’s found that, a year later, these firms’ total debt amounted to $14.2 trillion, eclipsing the $13.1 trillion of outstanding debt in the United States and making China the world’s largest issuer of corporate debt.
There is no indication that the ratio will decline anytime soon, which is particularly worrisome, given the low profitability and high borrowing costs that China’s industrial enterprises face.
Indeed, Chinese firms’ profitability amounted to just over 6% last year, with 2012 profits for China’s 500 largest (mostly state-owned) corporations barely exceeding 2%.
Meanwhile, interest rates on bank loans to nonfinancial enterprises remain close to 7%, despite having fallen slightly over the last year.
And, in the second quarter of this year, the annualized interest rate on loans to small nonfinancial corporations surpassed 25%.
With insufficient profits to use for investment, nonfinancial corporations will become increasingly dependent on external finance.
As their leverage ratios increase, so will their risk premiums, causing their borrowing costs to rise and undermining their profitability further.
This destructive cycle will be difficult to break.
For example, if companies reduce investment, they will weaken growth and boost their leverage ratio further.
To be sure, China overcame a similar challenge in its public sector from 1998 to 2001.
It pursued growth-boosting investment in infrastructure and real-estate development to eliminate deflation, while maintaining artificially low interest rates to contain the rise of public debt.
But a lot has changed since then.
In fact, the investment-led growth model that facilitated double-digit growth in the decade after 2001 has exacerbated structural weaknesses, which must now be addressed.
Indeed, China must stem the pace of real-estate investment, which accounted for more than 13% of GDP in recent years – a move that will undoubtedly lead to slower economic growth and, in turn, reduce the profitability of China’s nonfinancial corporates further.
Moreover, ongoing interest-rate liberalization – which has occurred both openly and surreptitiously – means that artificially low borrowing costs have become far more difficult to maintain.
Though the People’s Bank of China still officially caps interest rates on deposits, commercial banks – in cooperation with nonbank financial institutions, especially trust companies – are using wealth-management products to attract deposits with de facto free-market interest rates.
As a result, the PBOC is losing control over interest rates on corporate loans, and thus has few options for constraining leverage ratios.
Despite these risks, it is too early to bet on a corporate-debt crisis in China.
For starters, no one knows at what corporate leverage ratio a crisis will be triggered.
In 1996, when Japan’s public debt/GDP ratio reached 80%, many Japanese economists and officials worried about a looming crisis.
Almost two decades later, the ratio has surpassed 200% – and still no crisis has erupted.
Furthermore, China has not yet completed its market-orientated reforms, which could unleash major growth potential in many areas.
Given the role that institutional factors play in China’s corporate-debt problem, such reforms could go a long way toward resolving it.
China’s leaders should take advantage of this respite from instability and low confidence to redouble their reform efforts.
Otherwise, they can expect alarm bells to begin ringing again – and, next time, they may not have the tools they need to silence them.

The Enigma of European Defense
PARIS – While Europe’s citizens largely support the establishment of a common security and defense policy, most European leaders have demonstrated a clear lack of interest in creating one – including at last month’s European Council meeting.
What accounts for this paradox?
One possible explanation is that financially strained European governments lack the means to fulfill their citizens’ expectations.
But that is unconvincing, given that the issue was framed in almost identical terms three decades ago, when budgetary constraints were not a problem.
In fact, it could be argued that such constraints should spur, not impede, the creation of a European defense structure.
After all, member countries would then be able to pool their resources, harmonize programs, and rationalize costs, thereby reducing individual governments’ financial burden.
Another, far more credible explanation is that Europeans’ interpretations of “a more active and stronger security policy” differ widely.
Indeed, current discussions in Europe concerning the use of force are dominated by three main perspectives, championed by France, the United Kingdom, and Germany.
France, which has once again intervened in Africa – this time to restore order in the Central African Republic – is the only European Union country that seems genuinely interested in satisfying popular demand for more robust European security structures.
The French consider Europe to be a kind of superpower – a status that implies a corresponding military capacity.
While this view probably stems from France’s historical political and military prowess, it also reflects the country’s current interests.
As Europe’s greatest military power (despite the UK’s larger defense budget), France would play a key role in any wide-ranging European military operation.
The UK, for its part, shares France’s belief that military power is a prerequisite to strategic effectiveness. It claims that its opposition to a European defense structure stems from its belief that NATO – and thus the United States – is critical to European defense.
But, given that no other EU country has seriously considered excluding NATO, this argument seems to be little more than an excuse.
The truth is that the only kind of defense the British accept is that conducted by a coalition of European states acting under their national flags, as occurred in Libya.
In the UK’s view, “European” operations should be limited to humanitarian and peacekeeping objectives.
While it supported the fight against piracy off the Horn of Africa, that was more a policing operation than a military one, and it was guided by a shared interest in protecting trade routes from the Middle East and Asia.
Germany’s vision of European defense is very different from the French and British perspectives.
Unlike the UK, Germany supports a European security and defense policy, proudly highlighting its consistent military budget and major presence in European missions (larger than that of the overstretched French).
And, though Germany shares the UK’s belief that NATO bears primary responsibility for protecting Europe, its view of European engagement is even more restrictive. In Germany’s view, European military intervention should be limited to the continent, and should not include combat operations.
In fact, a majority of Europe’s citizens prefer that European forces be deployed only for non-combat missions.
And, so far, virtually all European military operations have been aimed at evacuating European nationals, delivering humanitarian aid, or maintaining peace in the aftermath of conflict.
These differing views explain the uncertainty surrounding France’s recent interventions in Africa.
The French have lamented the miniscule support offered by the rest of Europe for its operations in Mali and the Central African Republic – exemplified by Germany’s refusal to create a fund for EU member-state operations.
But, given the urgency of the situations in Libya, Mali, and the Central African Republic, this lack of support has not undermined France’s efforts as much as prior consultation with European leaders would have done.
Had the Germans been consulted, they probably would have rejected the interventions anyway.
This conflict between the need for rapid response and the requirement for deliberation explains why the EU’s much-discussed “battlegroups” are unlikely ever to be deployed.
The fact that most Europeans are satisfied with limited political and military involvement outside of Europe makes increased defense cooperation even less likely.
A pessimist would say that Europeans are unable – or at least unwilling – to rethink their defense policy, because the US ultimately ensures their security through NATO.
According to this view, France’s efforts to encourage both transatlantic integration and autonomous political action are insufficient to change most Europeans’ minds.
A more optimistic interpretation is that Europe needs defense structures that account for the role of member states – not just for that of the EU.
From this perspective, Europe does have a significant military presence, whether in Afghanistan and Libya or Mali and the Central African Republic.
That is a start.

The GDP-Wellbeing Gap
KUALA LUMPUR – The link between economic growth and human wellbeing seems obvious.
Indeed, as measured by gross domestic product, economic growth is widely viewed as the ultimate development objective. But it is time to rethink this approach.
In fact, there is a rising disconnect between countries’ per capita GDP and their citizens’ wellbeing, as rapid output growth exacerbates health challenges and erodes environmental conditions.
Given this, people increasingly value non-material wealth just as highly as monetary wealth, if not more.
But persuading policymakers and politicians of GDP’s limitations is no easy feat.
After all, it is far simpler to defend a well-understood, long-accepted framework than it is to champion a new worldview.
To be sure, GDP provides valuable information about a country’s production, expenditure, and income streams, as well as the flow of goods across borders.
Moreover, it has provided crucial guidance to countries, helping them to track economic gains that have improved citizens’ quality of life considerably – in many cases lifting them out of destitution.
But GDP fails to account for changes in a country’s stock of assets, making it difficult for policymakers to balance economic, social, and environmental concerns.
Without better measures of wellbeing – including health, education, and the state of the natural environment – policymakers cannot gain the insights that they need to ensure the long-term health of the economy and the individuals who comprise it.
This imperative underpins the concept of “sustainable development,” which has gradually gained acceptance since its introduction in the mid-1980’s. But, even as countries have recognized the need for a more comprehensive understanding of development, they have largely retained GDP growth as their central objective.
This has to change.
Even US-based Nobel laureate Simon Kuznets, the depression-era father of GDP, said in 1934 that, “the welfare of a nation can scarcely be inferred from a measure of national income.”
The good news is that a robust, simple, and effective framework for measuring sustainability already exists.
Developed by a group of leading economists, including the Nobel laureate Kenneth Arrow and Partha Dasgupta of the University of Cambridge, it assesses an economy’s income flows in the context of its stocks of assets, including human and natural capital.
In other words, it accounts for the economy’s productive base, rather than just its monetary wealth.
Based on this framework, United Nations University and the UN Environment Program unveiled the Inclusive Wealth Report (IWR) at the 2012 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.
By providing a long-term comparison between GDP and “inclusive wealth” for 20 countries, the report aimed to motivate policymakers to take a more comprehensive, longer-term view of their economies’ development.
This November, a second IWR will be released, with many more countries represented and a stronger focus on human capital in national-account indicators.
To this end, collaborating experts will convene in Malaysia this month for a series of meetings, culminating in a public symposium entitled “Beyond Gross Domestic Product – Transitioning into Sustainability.”
Transforming the world’s understanding of economic development requires a dynamic approach.
Experts in various fields – including economics, sociology, psychology, and the natural sciences – must work together to develop an integrated suite of indicators that provides a comprehensive picture of humanity’s productive base, on which people’s ability to pursue their interpretation of success depends.
While final decisions should rest with policymakers and citizens, the process must be guided by the best available science, uncompromised by political demands or vested interests.
Moreover, one fundamental truth must be recognized: the planet cannot accommodate high-income status for all seven billion of its inhabitants.
For every country to attain per capita GDP of $13,000 (which, according to the World Bank, delineates high-income status), global GDP would need to rise from roughly $72 trillion today to $91 trillion.
If, however, we already use the equivalent of 1.5 earths to provide the resources we consume and to absorb our waste, the planet can sustainably support a GDP of only $48-50 trillion.
And if the planet already exceeds its sustainable carrying capacity, we should be reducing our demands on it – not adding new ones.
Simply put, we can no longer depend on GDP growth, and the limitless wealth accumulation that it implies, to solve our social and economic problems.
The world must align its value systems with this reality.
We must learn to do more with less, decouple economic growth from resource consumption, and nurture the social and spiritual aspects of our existence.
This shift will be impossible without fundamental changes to our education systems, political structures, and institutions.
It is a tall order, but our future depends on fulfilling it.

A Zero-Carbon Economy Is Within Reach
BEIJING – When the Paris climate agreement was concluded in December 2015, almost all the world’s countries committed to limit global warming to well below 2° Celsius relative to pre-industrial levels, and have submitted “Intended Nationally Determined Contributions” (INDCs) describing how they will either contain or reduce emissions over the next decade.
Global investment in renewable power now far exceeds investment in fossil fuel plants; battery costs are falling, and electric vehicle sales rising; and even in President Donald Trump’s America, coal-fired power stations continue to close.
But despite this progress, the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) contains a chilling prediction: on current trends, the world is heading toward 3°C of global warming by 2100, to a level not reached for more than a million years.
The harm to human welfare is likely to be catastrophic.
The IPCC report makes it clear that the ideal target should be to limit warming to 1.5°C. Above that level, the adverse consequences become ever more extreme.
But to achieve that goal, global carbon dioxide emissions would have to reach net zero by about 2055, and still earlier if, as is unfortunately inevitable, emissions remain at current levels for several more years.
The precise implications for acceptable emissions from power stations, industrial plants, transport networks, and heating systems depend on how rapidly emissions caused by land-use change such as deforestation can be eliminated, and how rapidly emissions of non-CO2 greenhouse gases (for example, methane or nitrous oxide) can be reduced.
But it’s clear that unless we get to net zero emissions from energy use and industry by around 2060 – and earlier in developed economies – we will have to rely on the risky assumption that land-use changes can deliver large negative emissions in the late twenty-first century.
Failing that, warming will rise significantly above 1.5°C.
Getting to net zero emissions in just four decades will be a huge challenge.
But as a forthcoming report from the Energy Transitions Commission argues, the good news is that it is undoubtedly technically possible, and at an acceptably low cost to the global economy.
Moreover, we already know the key technologies we need to achieve this objective.
All feasible paths to a low-carbon economy and, eventually, net zero CO2 emissions require a massive increase in the role of electricity.
The share of electricity in final energy demand will have to grow from around 20% today to around 60% by mid- to late century, and total global electricity generation will have to rise dramatically, from around 25,000 TWh today to as much as 100,000 TWh.
That electricity must come from low-carbon sources.
And while nuclear power and gas generation offset by carbon capture may play a role, the lion’s share will have to come from renewable sources – 70-80% in the IPCC’s scenarios.
But there is plenty enough land in the world to support renewable expansion on that scale, and enough time to make the necessary investments as long as we act fast.
Three other sets of technologies will also be essential.
First, hydrogen, ammonia, and perhaps methanol must be used as energy carriers in transport and industrial applications and as chemical feedstock inputs.
All three will eventually be produced synthetically, using clean electricity as the ultimate energy source.
Second, biomass could provide low-carbon aviation fuel, or feedstock for plastics production.
The total scale of use, however, will need to be carefully managed to avoid harmful impacts on ecosystems and food supply.
Third, there should be at least some role for carbon capture, and either storage or use, in key industrial processes such as cement production, where viable alternative routes to decarbonization are currently unavailable.
Building a zero-carbon economy will of course require massive investment in power production and transmission, new industrial plants, and more efficient equipment.
To achieve the 1.5°C objective, the IPCC estimates that the required additional global investment, from 2015 to 2050, could be $900 billion per annum.
That may seem like a startlingly high figure; but, assuming 3% annual economic growth, global GDP, which stands at almost $100 trillion today, could reach $260 trillion by 2050.
This implies that the world needs to invest less than 0.6% of its income over the next four decades to avoid potentially catastrophic harm to human welfare.
China alone currently invests more than $5 trillion each year, a significant proportion of which is wasted on the construction of apartment blocks which will never be occupied in cities which face static and eventually declining populations.
By redirecting investment, China could build a zero-carbon economy without any sacrifice of consumption.
For the world as a whole, the impact on living standards of achieving net zero emissions will be trivial.
But while a zero-carbon economy is undoubtedly technically feasible and easily affordable, it will not be achieved without strong public policies and forward-looking business strategies.
Governments must deliver carbon pricing and product regulation and support key technologies and infrastructures, and companies in the energy-producing and main energy-using sectors must develop strategies focused on how to achieve zero emissions by mid-century and how to begin the transition today.
The alternative is another decade of only incremental progress, which will put us on a catastrophic path toward 3°C warming within the lifetime of today’s children.

The Tricks of China’s Trade
BEIJING – Last year, China ostensibly reached another milestone in its meteoric rise, surpassing the United States to become the world’s largest trading country, with its total trade turnover valued at CN¥25.83 trillion ($4.16 trillion). But this achievement is largely illusory – and should not be allowed to obscure China’s need to transform its trading model.
Since the 1990s, China’s has been building up its “processing trade” – whereby it imports intermediate inputs from other countries, processes or assembles them, then exports them – causing the ratio of intermediate-product trade to overall external trade to grow rapidly.
Intermediate inputs comprise around 28% of global exports, but 40% of China’s total exports.
Given that traditional trade accounting is based on country of origin, the resulting global segmentation of value added and the multilayered international division of labor can distort trade figures.
For example, the “triangular trade” model – whereby China imports significant quantities of intermediate inputs from East Asian countries like Japan and South Korea, then exports the assembled products to the US – allows for substantial redundancy in trade records.
In 2010, more than one-quarter of the world’s $19 trillion in exports was counted more than once.
China’s dependence on low value-added activities like processing and assembly is rooted in its historical lack of capacity to invest in research and development.
For a long time, the country was able to overcome this deficiency by capitalizing on its abundant labor force to become a global leader in low-cost, labor-intensive manufacturing.
But China’s low-cost advantage in manufacturing is diminishing rapidly, owing to rising wages and a declining demographic dividend. And its low position in global value chains means that its actual profits on exports remain far lower than those of advanced countries like the US, which specializes in high-technology, high-value-added production.
This combination of rising labor costs and low value added is clearly unsustainable.
If China is to transform itself from a large trading country into a powerful one, it must raise its productivity, with the manufacturing sector adding more value to exports (and, increasingly, to goods for domestic consumption).
To be sure, China’s enduring comparative advantage in processing and assembling industrial products has enabled it to retain its status as the world’s largest exporter.
As massive quantities of labor-intensive processing and assembly work have been transferred to China from Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, so have these economies’ trade surpluses.
Moreover, this has contributed to large – and widely criticized – trade imbalances with the US and the European Union, the primary end markets for Chinese-processed industrial products.
But, again, the data may not be what they seem.
Consider China’s growing re-import trade, whereby goods that have been exported to nearby countries, particularly Hong Kong, return to the mainland.
China’s re-imports have increased more than 12-fold since 2000, and now dwarf those of other re-importing leaders as a share of total trade.
Given Hong Kong’s advanced logistics and infrastructure, it is a relatively inexpensive and efficient conduit through which products can be shipped.
In 2011, Hong Kong handled about 14% of mainland China’s exports and 13% of its imports, with more than 60% of Hong Kong’s total re-exports originating from the Chinese mainland.
Meanwhile, by exporting products through designated export-processing zones, companies gain access to export-tax refunds and, once the intermediate cargo is imported and processed, advantageous export tariffs.
Re-imports from China’s trading partners are counted as part of total imports – and, in this context, China treats Hong Kong as a trading partner, rather than as a free-trade zone.
In this way, re-imports serve to inflate China’s trade data, meaning that the trade imbalance between China and the advanced countries has been exaggerated significantly.
Furthermore, model simulations show that the Chinese export sectors that have greater ratios of value added abroad are concentrated in the manufacturing industry – the industry upon which China’s economy is most dependent.
Indeed, 26% of the value added by the primary manufacturing sector is not created by China.
Taking this into account, China’s trade surplus with the US declines by 36%.
China’s surpluses with Europe and India also fall considerably, and its deficit with Japan grows even larger.
These figures carry the unmistakable message that the amount of “filler” in China’s total trade volume should not be underestimated.
Given the importance of moving up the value chain to China’s future industrial competitiveness – not to mention the challenge posed by “reindustrialization” in advanced countries like the US – China’s leaders must act now to give the economy a new edge that can replace abundant, low-cost labor.
To this end, they should promote investment in research and development, as well as in the health and education of the labor force.
Likewise, China should cultivate its own transnational corporations to engage in worldwide manufacturing and sales.
While these activities may seem like the simple cross-border export of intermediate products, they amount to the deployment and extension of domestic production, enhancing the home country’s role in shaping global value chains.
Finally, China should participate actively in the global movement toward bilateral, trilateral, and regional free-trade agreements, accelerating negotiations for agreements with Japan and South Korea, and with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
At the same time, in order to elevate China’s position in the revenue distribution of global value chains, China should seek negotiations for agreements with the US and Europe.
Before any of this can occur, however, China’s leaders much change their perspective.
China’s recognition as the world’s largest trading country is not the fetchingly redundant “landmark milestone” that its leaders declared.
That charmed point will be reached when Chinese industry raises its position within – and influence over – global value chains.

Zika and Reproductive Rights
NEW YORK – Mosquitoes know no boundaries, and neither does fear.
As public-health experts grapple with the Zika virus, panic continues to spread around the world.
Yet the crisis has brought to light two important truths.
The first revelation is how badly degraded public health systems have become, across Latin America and beyond.
This did not happen by chance.
In large part, it is the result of pressure on developing countries by concessionary lenders, such as the International Monetary Fund, to cut social sector expenses, including health spending, beginning in 1980.
In Brazil and elsewhere, state authorities could have deployed well-known and cost-effective measures to control mosquito-borne diseases, but they did not.
Their most affected citizens, who tend to be poor, have been forced to live with the consequences.
Second, the Zika epidemic has revealed, with particular poignancy, another dire threat to public health: the denial of women’s reproductive rights.
Governments are shirking their responsibility in this regard too, often in a grotesque manner.
The reported spike in cases of microcephaly – a birth defect – among infants in Zika-affected areas led the governments of Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and El Salvador to warn their female citizens “not to become pregnant.”
This message, which places the blame and burden of the Zika epidemic on women, is as unjust as it is unreasonable.
It is also toothless, as many women in the region do not have access to contraception or safe abortions.
The Zika crisis has highlighted an obvious reality: Not providing women with reproductive health information and services places their lives – and those of their children – at grave risk.
Latin America’s abortion laws are among the world’s most restrictive.
El Salvador, for example, bans abortion in all circumstances and has incarcerated women who have gone to emergency rooms after miscarriages, charging them with seeking illegal abortions.
Contraception can also be expensive or difficult to access across the region, despite high rates of teenage rape and pregnancy.
The result, especially with the addition of the Zika virus, is a recipe for tragedy.
Brazil, the Latin American country hit hardest by the virus so far, is emblematic of the problem: Abortion is allowed only in cases of rape, danger to the woman’s life, or in the case of fetal anencephaly (the absence of a major portion of the brain).
In response to the Zika crisis, Brazil should immediately allow abortion in cases of suspected microcephaly as well.
The loosening of restrictions, however, should not stop there.
Over the last few years, conservatives in the Brazilian Congress have been trying to place limits on abortion in cases of rape.
These efforts – which demonstrate complete disregard for the rights and dignity of women – must end.
Instead, women’s right to seek an abortion should be expanded – and quickly.
Governments must also ensure that services are accessible and affordable.
Wealthy Brazilian women can afford to pay private health providers for safe abortions.
Poor women are forced to resort to poorly trained and equipped providers who operate in unsanitary conditions, sometimes as part of criminal networks.
In September 2014, two women died in Rio de Janeiro following clandestine abortions.
In the region overall, 95% of abortions are unsafe.
In Latin America and the Caribbean, 62% of women aged 15-49 want to avoid a pregnancy.
But nearly a quarter of these women are not using an effective method of birth control.
Expense is only one barrier for poor women and girls; another is the lack of information.
Men and women need comprehensive sexuality education, so they are informed about their reproductive health and family planning options and know where they can get modern contraceptives.
Recent evidence suggesting that Zika might be transmitted sexually adds extra urgency to making male and female condoms and other contraceptives widely available.
The movement for reproductive rights has a long history in Brazil and in other parts of Latin America.
Over the last several months – even before Zika – feminists had been taking to the streets in outrage at the lack of access to safe and legal abortions.
The Zika crisis may mark a turning point in the fight for women’s health and equality.
It is certainly a wake-up call for governments everywhere to rebuild and strengthen public health systems, and to guarantee all women and girls access to contraceptives and safe abortions.
Women and girls around the world know the alternative – and it is terrifying.

The Injustices of Zika
SOUTHAMPTON – Outbreaks of communicable diseases in the developing world are bad enough from a health perspective.
But they also have serious implications for social justice, because they exacerbate longstanding human-rights crises, including by undermining already-weak public-services provision and deepening existing inequalities.
Like the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the Zika outbreak in Central and South America in 2015 hit vulnerable social groups – women and children, ethnic minorities, and the poor – the hardest.
Like yellow fever, dengue, and other diseases, Zika is transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.
But, unusually for a mosquito-borne virus, Zika can also be transmitted sexually.
Even more unusual, it is associated with neurological and developmental conditions affecting babies: microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome.
Otherwise, its symptoms are often rather mild.
This means that, of the more than 1.5 million people stricken by Zika since the outbreak, the consequences were most worrying for women of child-bearing age, especially those who were already pregnant.
Between 2016 and 2017, a total of 11,059 Zika cases in pregnant women were confirmed, producing 10,867 cases of microcephaly and other congenital malformations of their babies’ central nervous systems.
Fifty-six percent of those babies were born to poor women and women of color from northeast Brazil.
Clearly,the Zika crisis is not gender-neutral.
In addressing its medium- to long-term consequences, a focus on women – especially poor women – is needed.
That does not mean more media coverage of the deformities associated with microcephaly or even of the difficulties faced by their mothers.
And it certainly does not mean more efforts to police women’s behavior.
To avoid infection, women have been advised to use mosquito repellent; remove standing water around their homes; wear long sleeves; and, if possible, use condoms or avoid sex.
The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention advised pregnant women to refrain from traveling to affected countries.
Most extreme, health officials in El Salvador and Colombia urged women not to get pregnant until 2018.
Such recommendations, however well intended they may be, are fundamentally flawed.
For starters, they emphasize short-term-vector control and surveillance, while delinking the disease from the social and structural determinants of health, including public infrastructure such as running water, proper sanitation, and access to care.
They also place the responsibility for avoiding disease and pregnancy primarily on women, while failing to recognize the lack of control many women have over their bodies and pregnancies.
Many of the areas affected by Zika have high rates of sexual violence and teen pregnancy, a lack of sex education, and inadequate access to contraceptives.
For these reasons, more than 50% of pregnancies in Latin America are unintended.
Making matters worse, in most Latin American countries affected by Zika, abortion is illegal, or permitted only in exceptional situations.
For example, in El Salvador, where more than 7,000 cases of Zika were reported between December 2015 and January 2016, abortions are illegal under all circumstances.
Miscarriages, if proven to be self-induced, can even lead to homicide convictions.
The position of the United States hasn’t helped, either.
Last year, US President Barack Obama’s administration asked Congress for $1.8 billion in emergency funding to help prepare for and respond to the Zika threat.
But abortion politics intervened, as Republican lawmakers, leading a congressional hearing on the Zika outbreak, made the funding conditional on anti-abortion policies in recipient countries.
The problems with the dominant approach to containing the Zika virus – namely, that it saddles women with too much responsibility while giving them too little power – are not lost on everyone.
Last year, the United Nations Refugee Agency and the World Health Organization emphasized the need to put human rights at the center of the response to the Zika outbreak.
But, while high-level recognition of women’s sexual and reproductive rights is a positive step, it is far from sufficient.
And doing what is needed to protect those rights, particularly among poor and vulnerable women in developing countries, will require deep and sustained political commitment.
In particular, national legislation must be revised to ensure that all women – whether they are carrying a baby with microcephaly or not – have full reproductive autonomy.
Women must be able to base their reproductive choices on their own physical and emotional needs and desires, not on the moral judgments of powerful agents or risk of criminal sanctions.
Advocacy groups in Brazil, for example, are already pushing for such an outcome, submitting legal cases to the Supreme Court to secure greater reproductive rights for women, including the right to safe and legal abortion.
Those cases tend to lean on the 1988 National Constitution, which guarantees the right to abortion in case of rape, danger to the mother’s life, or anencephaly, another birth defect involving the brain.
In pursuing these changes, campaigns should also recognize and address the links between women’s and disability rights.
Indeed, they should advance equality for all marginalized groups.
Zika’s medium- and long-term consequences must be addressed with this in mind.
When a woman gives birth to a child with a congenital syndrome deriving from the Zika virus, the response should be grounded in the dignity, value, and rights of each individual. It should acknowledge the processes that keep certain individuals and groups in poverty and that deny them the basic rights of citizens.
That is why campaigners must insist that the state be responsible for providing appropriate care and support services for each woman and child – services that both meet their needs and respect their rights.

Zimbabwe's Last Chance
As the world rooted for former United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan in his recent efforts to end the violence in Kenya, many also found themselves wondering whether a weary Annan, or some other global leader, will be battling another fire by the end of this month: this time in Zimbabwe.
Zimbabwe’s upcoming elections, scheduled for March 29, offer both fear and hope to the millions trapped in or trying to escape the country’s hellish conditions.
Even official data now put the inflation rate at more than 100,000%, and the plight of ordinary Zimbabweans grows more desperate by the day.
The elections could bring Zimbabweans a chance to end the long dictatorship of President Robert Mugabe.
But, without supervision, they will be held in an environment that could dash Zimbabweans’ hopes.
Zimbabweans are denied their basic freedoms and subjected to violence.
Torture is widespread.
Civil society groups report the arrests of opposition electoral candidates, the manipulation of food supplies for political purposes, and violent incidents of voter intimidation.
The Zimbabwe Election Support Network has also expressed concern about the country’s state of readiness for this complex election, which will combine presidential, parliamentary, senatorial, and local government contests.
And this is to say nothing of the structural faults that continue to impede political progress – a defective constitution, censored media, and a partisan security and military establishment.
It didn’t have to be this way.
This past year has seen one missed opportunity after another.
South African president Thabo Mbeki convened negotiations with Zimbabwe’s political groups; but they have been so unfruitful that opposition leaders recently all but accused Mbeki of lying to the world about the progress of the talks.
Some African leaders – notably Ghana’s president, John Kufuor, and outgoing African Union head Alpha Konare – have tried to cajole Mugabe towards reform, to no avail.
Perhaps more significantly, the international community’s failure to address Zimbabwe seriously shows, once again, that it lacks the political will to prevent foreseeable crises.
Last year, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour condemned the regime’s use of torture and its mistreatment of pro-democracy forces.
Regrettably, the UN failed to follow up with institutional action.
The UN would say it must be invited into a country before it can take certain forms of action, such as sending official election observers.
But it is also true that with adequate political will, the UN Security Council could live up to its responsibility to Zimbabweans by responding to the crisis more aggressively.
The UN should have put Mugabe on the defensive with a forceful public offer to help Zimbabwe prepare for internationally supervised elections.
Instead, the UN continues to defer to Mugabe, who hides behind claims of sovereignty while jailing a defenseless populace.
With so many lives at stake, what can be done to avert an intensification of the Zimbabwe crisis?
People of good will throughout the world, including those affiliated with multilateral organizations like the UN, should descend on Zimbabwe to observe this month’s elections.
Accredited or not, they should stand in solidarity with the people of Zimbabwe at this crucial moment, act as witnesses to the deteriorating pre-election environment, and serve as a bulwark against any escalation of state brutality during and after the vote.
Mugabe would prefer to limit the presence of international observers to those sent by neighboring states – the same allies that somehow managed to deem the violent and fraudulent elections of the past seven years “legitimate.”
Zimbabwe’s neighbors also face a choice: they can use their proximity to halt Mugabe’s abuses, or to shield him from international scrutiny and rebuke.
Their choice may depend on what the world demands of them.
The people of Zimbabwe will play their part on March 29.
As for the regional and world community, their actions today and in the coming weeks could make the difference between a reprise of the violence in Kenya and the first step towards a more stable and democratic future.

Zimbabwe’s Permanent Guantánamo
JOHANNESBURG – Last week, the United States Supreme Court ruled that detainees at Guantánamo Bay have the right to habeas corpus – the right to challenge the factual and legal basis of their detention in a court of law.
I was elated by the decision, having spent four years working on ensuring the rule of law in US detention and interrogation policy, including monitoring military commission trials at Guantánamo Bay.
But my happiness is tempered by where I sit, close to the border with Zimbabwe – a country where the writ of habeas corpus and the rule of law have become obsolete.
Habeas corpus, Latin for “you have the body,” is an old English common law principle incorporated into the US Constitution to ensure freedom from unlawful detention by the state.
It was and continues to be a critical check against the imprisonment of individuals without oversight by independent courts.
In Zimbabwe, this right – like so many other checks and balances – has been torn away by a repressive state.
Just hours before the US Supreme Court ruling, Tendai Biti, the Secretary-General of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), was arrested upon his return to Zimbabwe.
Despite immediate attempts by his lawyers to locate him, his whereabouts remained unknown for days.
The police dismissed an initial court order demanding that Biti be produced before the court.
After Biti was finally produced before the court days later, the government announced that he will be charged with treason – which carries the death penalty – for unofficially announcing the results of the March 29, 2008, elections. Prior to his detention, Biti had responded to such allegations by stating that his only crime was to fight for democracy in Zimbabwe.
It is unlikely that he will be able to challenge the basis of his detention in an independent court.
Since 1999, the MDC has offered a democratic alternative to President Robert Mugabe’s regime.
In the most recent elections, Zimbabweans made their choice known, despite serious obstacles and widespread repression, with the MDC’s presidential candidate, Morgan Tsvangirai, gaining more votes than Mugabe.
But, according to the vote counts released by the government after a suspicious month-long delay, the MDC’s margin of victory – 48% to 43% – fell short of the 50% required to avoid a run-off election.
Biti is not the only MDC member to be “disappeared” for a period of time by Mugabe’s government.
Over the past two years, police and government-supported paramilitaries have routinely jailed, beaten, and even killed MDC officials and suspected MDC members.
Last year, Biti was detained and beaten along with Tsvangirai and dozens of other MDC officials.
The photos of Tsvangirai’s pummeled body led to an international outcry.
State-sponsored violence against the MDC and its supporters has escalated as the June 27 run-off vote draws near.
Just weeks ago, Biti described the discovery of the mutilated body of Tonderai Ndira, an MDC youth leader.
Ndira had been taken by the police from his home.
He was missing for seven days; when his body was found, it was recognizable only by a bracelet he always wore.
Here in our offices in Johannesburg, we have two Zimbabwean lawyers who fled their country after receiving death threats for their work defending human rights.
At least five of their clients have been murdered in the past few weeks.
Most recently, the Zimbabwean police suspended the work of numerous human rights organizations that were documenting the recent violence.
It is hard to imagine that a free and fair election can take place against the backdrop of such intense and systemic violence.
Indeed, even South African president Thabo Mbeki, who, despite an outcry from many of his citizens, has supported Mugabe, felt compelled to label it a “cause for serious concern.”
In the majority opinion in Boumediene v. Bush , Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote that “Liberty and security can be reconciled; and in our system they are reconciled within the framework of the law.”
But there is no rule of law left in Zimbabwe – no habeas corpus and no check on arbitrary state action.
It is time for the international community to step in, call for an end to the detention and disappearance of MDC officials and perceived supporters, and push for a democratic transition in Zimbabwe.
Only then can the principles underlying the Supreme Court’s decision come within reach of ordinary Zimbabweans.

Zimbabwe’s Plight, South Africa’s Responsibility
JOHANNESBURG – Morgan Tsvangirai’s withdrawal from the presidential run-off scheduled for June 27, and his decision to seek the protection of the Dutch embassy in Pretoria, has secured for Zimbabwe’s President Robert Mugabe a Pyrrhic victory.
Mugabe’s triumph comes at a huge cost to democracy and stability in Zimbabwe, as well as in the region.
The actions of the Mugabe regime in the run-up to Tsvangirai’s decision demand a strong regional response to what is clearly a stolen victory.
Indeed, Mugabe’s continuing in power represents the most serious challenge to Africa’s nascent democratic institutions and to South Africa’s vision of a continent of peace and prosperity.
After contesting every election since 2000, Tsvangirai’s Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) has changed tactics reluctantly.
Under the circumstances, South Africa and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) urgently need to reappraise their approach not only to Mugabe, but to how they will deal with any uncontested election.
A host of declarations adopted over the years by the SADC and the African Union address the conduct of elections on the continent.
These include the SADC Principles and Guidelines Governing Democratic Elections (2004), the African Charter on Democracy, Elections, and Governance (2007), and the Declaration on the Principles Governing Democratic Elections in Africa (2002).
None of these principles have been respected in Zimbabwe, and regional leaders have not cited their violation as reason to censure Mugabe’s government.
Unfortunately, we have a recent precedent for this type of behavior: Kenya’s rulers, too, ignored and twisted the rule of law and the integrity of the electoral process, relying on violence to secure a political outcome that their fellow citizens denied them.
Dealing effectively with political instability in Africa requires two things: the political will of key states to underwrite the democratic process, and strong regional institutions to provide a legal framework reflecting the principles underpinning states’ behavior.
The effectiveness of regional institutions and the role of regional powers are interlinked.
Regional institutions can entrench themselves only if their members promote adherence to the spirit and letter of their legal frameworks.
In both cases, South Africa – the main regional power with the most levers of influence over Zimbabwe – has a vital role to play.
But does South Africa really see itself as a regional power?
Its handling of Mugabe over the past eight years has actually underplayed its leverage.
Yet the mantle of a regional power sometimes requires using that leverage for the greater good of the region.
What should South Africa do now?
Should President Thabo Mbeki step down as mediator in the Zimbabwe crisis, not because he has failed, but to remove from South Africa the constraints that being a mediator put in place?
South Africa has a vested interest in stability, and it can turn the screws on Mugabe’s regime, much as it has refused to contemplate any form of sanctions because of their impact on the poor.
South Africa must tap into the growing concern among Zimbabwe’s neighbors (Angola, Botswana, Tanzania, and Zambia) about the political crisis, and forge a united front within the SADC that sends a clear message to Mugabe and his generals that the region will no longer tolerate their actions.
The SADC should not endorse the regime’s claim of victory in an uncontested election.
It must insist that all opposition leaders and supporters be freed immediately, and that all state-sponsored violence be halted.
It should dispatch an eminent persons’ group of senior African and other international leaders to Zimbabwe, as well as peace monitors to ensure that the government complies with these demands.
The SADC’s censure of Mugabe and his regime should be backed up by concrete actions, such as restrictions on all arms flows to Zimbabwe, travel restrictions on senior officials of Zimbabwe’s ruling ZANU-PF party, and the threat of property seizures and the freezing of financial assets in the region and beyond.
Mbeki and other SADC leaders should recognize a key point.
According to legal opinions commissioned by the Southern African Litigation Center, Zimbabwe’s Electoral Act holds that the delay or absence of a lawful run-off means that the candidate who obtained the most votes in the election of March 29, 2008, has been duly elected as President.
Moreover, South Africa was instrumental in drafting the declaration on unconstitutional changes of government, adopted by the Organization of African Unity, the AU’s predecessor, in 1999.
The manner in which the electoral process in Zimbabwe has been conducted since March has been an unconstitutional continuation of government.
The declaration clearly stipulates that an incumbent government’s refusal to relinquish power to the winning party after free, fair, and regular elections is unconstitutional.
If South Africa sees itself as speaking for Africa on the global stage and creating a vision for the continent’s future, it must know when to lead and how to build consensus.
None of this is easy, but South Africa must now act decisively in order to polish its tarnished image as a responsible regional power.
“Business as usual” is no longer a viable approach for South African foreign policy.

Zoellick to the Rescue?
Will newly anointed World Bank President Robert Zoellick be able to get the organization back on its feet after the catastrophic failed presidency of Paul Wolfowitz?
Although hardly a megawatt star of the Bob Rubin category, he certainly brings some positive attributes to the job.
First, as a key player in bringing China into the World Trade Organization, Zoellick is a proven internationalist in an American administration where internationalists have sometimes seemed like an endangered species.
Second, he is a firm believer in the power of markets and free trade, which have clearly done far more to alleviate poverty over the past half-century than any aid program.
Third, he seems to have been a consistent behind-the-scenes supporter of the Bank, whereas many of his Bush administration colleagues would be just as happy to see it shut down and its Washington headquarters turned into private condominiums and offices.
So presumably he has a constructive vision for the Bank’s future.
But Zoellick is not without his weaknesses.
First and foremost, his appointment extends the embarrassingly outmoded practice of always installing an American in the job.
With the Bank tirelessly preaching the merits of good governance, its failure to adopt democratic principles undercuts its own legitimacy.
The claim that the World Bank needs an American president to ensure that the US keeps donating money is ridiculous.
The annual cost of the US contribution to the World Bank, even taking into account off-the-books loan guarantees, is relatively minor.
Any number of developing countries, from China to India to Brazil, could easily step up if the US foolishly stepped down.
Zoellick’s background as a lawyer hardly makes him perfect for the job, either.
The World Bank presidency is not about negotiating treaties, as Zoellick did when he was US Trade Representative. The Bank’s most important role in development today is as a “knowledge bank” that helps aggregate, distill, and disseminate best practices from around the world.
In this respect, the Bank’s technical assistance to governments is very similar to what private consultants offer to companies.
Moreover, many of the World Bank president’s most important decisions involve economics in an essential way.
Wrong economic decisions, such as in the 1970’s, when Robert McNamara pushed grandiose, but environmentally devastating, infrastructure projects, have haunted the Bank for decades.
The biggest question mark, though, is whether Zoellick will be able to hit the ground running and implement desperately needed reforms.
Reform number one, of course, is to ensure that the next World Bank President is not an American.
Rodrigo de Rato, Zoellick’s counterpart at the European-dominated International Monetary Fund, has already suggested that his successor should be chosen in a more inclusive process.
The World Bank should be ashamed that its president has not yet offered a similar proposal.
Second, Zoellick should ask why the Bank spends only 2.5% of its budget on the “knowledge bank” research function that it trumpets so proudly in its external relations materials, while it spends three times that amount on maintaining its executive board.
Third, Zoellick should use his formidable negotiating skills to cajole rich countries into greatly increasing the grant component of World Bank aid.
The idea that a big government-guaranteed global bank is needed to fill holes in private capital markets is laughable nowadays.
True, the Bank’s poorest clients have little access to private capital markets.
By and large, however, the poorest countries need grants, not loans that they still won’t be able to pay in 20 years.
As the Bank switches from loans to grants, it can use some of its massive retained earnings to endow its “knowledge bank” function and related technical advice.
But all this knowledge shouldn’t be free.
A lot of technical advice falls on deaf ears, with countries listening only long enough to get their hands on Bank money.
Instead of merely pushing its agenda, the Bank should start charging for its technical advice on a graduated scale so that more of its engagements are client-driven.
Last but not least, the Bank needs to play a much bigger role in environmental issues and, in general, in promoting good international citizenship by both rich and poor countries.
(Some of us have been proposing this for almost two decades.)
Of course, Zoellick could just attempt to fill the role symbolically and do little or nothing, as some of his predecessors have done.
Or, less likely, he could embrace some megalomaniacal and over-reaching vision of government intervention, as others have tried.
In any case, let’s wish him luck.
The world needs the World Bank a lot more than it needs another condominium.

Zuma Rising
The anxiety over Jacob Zuma’s election as president of South Africa obscures a significant milestone: for the first time in decades, a sub-Saharan nation has at its helm a champion of ordinary people.
African politics has long been the exclusive domain of aristocrats, soldiers, and technocrats.
Even with the spread of democratic elections, the region’s leaders tend to come from the ranks of soldiers (Uganda, Rwanda, Zimbabwe), family dynasties (Togo, Kenya, etc), or university professors, lawyers, and economists (Ghana, Malawi, Liberia).
Now South Africa, the region’s economic engine and home to its most sophisticated universities, media, and corporations, has a former goat herder at its helm, a rare African leader with the common touch.
Zuma is legendary for his ability to connect with ordinary people.
He’s secure enough to dance and sing in public.
He speaks the language of populism, raising hopes for the vast majority of South Africans who daily endure the misery of poor housing, schools, and health care.
In contrast to his two predecessors – the saintly Nelson Mandela, who emphasized racial healing, and the aristocratic Thabo Mbeki, who reassured financiers with his strong grasp of macroeconomics – Zuma recognizes the pent-up demand for material improvement in the lives of his country’s tens of millions of have-nots.
“We have learned from the mistakes of the past 15 years, especially the manner of which we may have, to some degree, neglected the people’s movement,” he said in April, before his African National Congress swept to victory.
Until now, populism has been the missing note in African political culture.
Zuma, who spent his youth herding cattle and only gained formal education while in the notorious Robben Island prison with Mandela, is refreshingly aware that Africa’s biggest problem is its inequalities, not its global marginalization.
In Africa’s wealthiest nation – but also the nation where wealth is most unequally shared – a bold populist now holds ultimate power over government policy.
Yet, while Zuma’s populist appeal reflects South Africa’s especially large differences in economic class, the threat of imposing higher taxes and other obligations on employers and the wealthy has raised fears at home and internationally.
Moreover, Zuma has been called a chameleon, accused of telling his audiences what they want to hear.
Zuma’s turbulent personal life – many wives and his embarrassing contention during a rape trial that he avoided HIV infection by taking a shower – has invited ridicule.
Most seriously, doubts persist about his commitment to democracy, with critics arguing he’s an old-style African “big man” ready to bully opponents and ravage the public coffers with his cronies.
Dismissing complaints, Zuma insists, “There’s no cloud around me.”
His defenders, meanwhile, point to two benefits that he has already delivered: an end to Mbeki’s ambivalent approach to fighting HIV/AIDS, the country’s major public health threat, and a refreshing willingness to move against Zimbabwe’s aged dictator, Robert Mugabe, whom Mbeki coddled out of a misguided sense of loyalty for his support during the struggle against apartheid.
In an Africa bereft of successful populist politicians, Zuma’s role models may come from Latin America, where income inequality is also extreme and the trade-union movement, as in South Africa, is strong and militant.
With enormous pressure from ordinary people to deliver tangible gains, Zuma the populist will quickly face a major test: will he emulate Lula of Brazil, who has struck an admirable balance between good economic governance and re-distribution of wealth to the poor?
Or will he follow the path of Hugo Chávez, a popular autocrat who seems to prefer building a cult of personality over raising living standards for the poor.
The stakes for Africa are enormous.
South Africa has the continent’s largest economy and, until the global financial crisis, posted 10 years of steady economic growth.
In an economic slowdown, the country’s severe crime problem might only worsen; so might unemployment, which already tops 20% in the formal economy.
Zuma senses the urgency of the situation.
He is, after all, 67 years old and likely to serve only a single term in office.
“We can’t waste time,” he says.
Yet, according to the political economist Moeletsi Mbeki, at his core, “Zuma is a conservative.”
In this sense, Zuma represents yesterday’s South Africa.
He is part of the proud generation that defeated apartheid – and then peacefully engineered a transition to durable black-majority rule.
Their achievement remains one of the greatest in recent history.
At the same time, Zuma’s revolutionary generation still seems uneasy leading South Africa in a post-apartheid era that is now 15 years old.
In a region that reveres the elderly, Zuma’s attachment to his rural traditions must be matched by an equal openness to the appetites of the country’s youth.
Three in ten South Africans are younger than 15, meaning that they did not live a day under apartheid.
Somehow Zuma must find a way to honor his own generation’s commitment to racial justice and national liberation, while empowering the masses who daily suffer the sting of class differences and yearn for material gain.
